            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The whole Work had long ſince been made publick, had it not (as the cauſe it juſtifies) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred much Perſecution, almoſt to its utter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. The malignity of our Adverſaeries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the weakneſs of the Doctor's charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; and fearing, leaſt the perverſneſs of their hearts, in impoſing and divulging ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent calumnies, ſhould become Viſible; has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained this your harmleſs Poſtill to a longer Voyage, then the timely Vindication of our Churches impeached Honour, would have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reaſonably allowed; Having now eſcaped many storms it walks alone, and ventures to look forth upon you; yet had its worthy Author been longer ſpared with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, you would have ſeen it in a fuller and more faſhionable dreſs; though even thus, it is not beneath your Expectations, offring unto your Conſideration, ſuch ſober Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, as well become the dignity of the Holy and Apoſtolical Religion of Catholicks, and do clearly Vindicate that our Way from the fouleſt aſperſions, carnal wiſdom could utter, againſt plain Truth and Honeſty.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57867:3"/>
            <p>Were that freedom, which the Doctor's provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations imply, allowed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, for a legal defence of our holy Church, which the Law of Nations, and our Venerable Courts of Juſtice afford the moſt wretched aſsayled Innocents, in Caſe of fraud and Calumny, againſt the Prevaricators of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace; It would be eaſy to manifeſt, that as our Catholick Doctrin and Devotions need no other Champion, then that Churches perfection and Majeſty: So her many Doctors, neither want skill or will, to put by thoſe weak thruſts, the Doctor makes at her reputation hitherto preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without blemiſh by God's aſſured providence, over her watchful Paſtours.</p>
            <p>The Doctor in this his Account of the Idolatry, Impiety, Fanaticiſm, Diviſions, (and what not of Iniquity?) of the Roman Church, hath ſumm'd up high Criminations againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; and then, having laid the Foundations of his own Belief, concludes, the Church of Rome, neither to be the Catholick Church, nor any ſound part, or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof; but whether he deſigned this his ſo peremptory a Charge, as an Obelisk, with <hi>GRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TITUDO POSUIT,</hi> to his thereby deluded Benefactours; or to be a new Diocleſian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne, with <hi>NOMINE CHRISTIANO DELETO,</hi> for this Age too; he knows beſt, who framed it; ſure it is his fundamentals are ſuch, that they ſubvert all Chriſtian Monarchy and Obedience, without which, not only Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
<pb facs="tcp:57867:4"/>but neither any Church, conſiſting of more then one member, can long preſerve its ſelf from mouldring into Diviſions and Deſolation.</p>
            <p>The truth is, if ever any Oppoſer of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, has betray'd his own Cauſe, this Doctor is notably guilty of it: for his Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s are ſo evidently ſlanderous, and the Principles of his own Religion ſo leakie that they have rendred the whole Reformation ſuſpected of a Notorious Cheat, in its growth and progreſs, to all unprejudiced Judgments; who by the ſober ways of our Religious Worſhip, our many great encouragements to piety, our zeal in obſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ving Evangelical Counſels, and our wonderful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the groundſills of our Chriſtianity, are clearly convinced of the holineſs of our Catholick Truths, and Maxims of Morality; and (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our Adverſaries loud declaimings againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, even from the Infancy of Chriſtian Religion, to this Age when the Reformation was <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhered in by unclean licentiouſneſs, much different from the ſubtil Errours of Primitive Diſſenters,) that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wit nor Malice of Man can overthrow the Faith and Moral Precepts of the Roman Church, conveyed unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s in her ſacred Canons; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as her Impugners ſtill, like <hi>Jonas</hi> Gourd, wither in their bloſſom; for the counſels of Men ſhall fail, according to the good Gamaliels Rule, but God and Truth have their Date everlaſting.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57867:4"/>
            <p>Had the Doctor as carefully peruſed the large Records of our Church Hiſtories, which treaſure up, and continue to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, the Body of our Chriſtian Belief and Rules of manners, unchanged through all its Ages, by the Vigilancy of her Apoſtolical Governors, by whom Primitive Truths have been unanimouſly conſerved, and conveyed unto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s in their Original Purity; as he has been in Rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the foul aſhes of ambitious Schiſmaticks. Scepticks, and Libertines, (the Cockle, that ſtill grows up with Chriſt's beſt corn); and in frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Creed by the Square of his Truth diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reaſon, that which Holy Scripture forbids to our utter peril; he had diſcovered, our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrin to be the very Image of her Divine Architype, who <hi>IS,</hi> and changes not; and who has accordingly laid the Foundation of, and built up, this our Impregnable City of the Pilgrim Saints; ſtill guarding It with his own ſacred Spirit, and aſſiſting her Viſible Paſtours, in the Government of that his Catholick Body, that as he hath promiſed, Hell may not prevail againſt it; Nor may the Doctor's ſevere Account hope o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſs herein, than the more powerful Swords of Pagan Ceſars, the Edicts of Senats. and the wrath of Flamins of the Old Heathen Rome; upon whoſe Ruins, our glorious Lord hath by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> built up this his everlaſting Church; in Communion wherewith only, we can pretend to the Title of Chriſtianity, or to the promiſes
<pb facs="tcp:57867:5"/>which Jeſus Christ has thereunto annexed; if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt's promiſe, or guift to, or prayers for S. <hi>Peter,</hi> may be allowed, to have either power with God, or any credit with Mankind.</p>
            <p>Hence Sir, the Doctor's Book, as it has bred admiration at his confidence, and contempt of his Malice, amongſt all Catholicks, who are better acquainted with their own Faith and practices, then to be inſtructed in them, or miſled from them, by any prevaricatours ſounding braſs or tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cymbal: ſo hath it raiſed up an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſome of the more learned Clergy, of Proteſtants, at that his boldneſs; and cauſed them to ſuſpect too, their own cauſe; which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo oft plaiſtring over their breach from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, with manifold <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths at length needs buttreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up with ſo palpably incredible calumnies, therein inſerted.

            <p>The Doctors whole Account amounts to a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down, and a ſetting up; firſt he pulls down the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then He ſets up his Own; he makes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of four formidable Engins to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn that our Catholick Church, which your <hi>TO KATHOLICO</hi> amply examines; But ſurely, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> falls, all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which either received their belief from her or now communicate in faith with her, muſt fall too; and thus the Catholick Church, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, an entire Article of the Apoſtles Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is on a ſudden cancelled.

            <p>His deſign in forging theſe his Principles was, thence to ſhew, the Proteſtant Church, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, or as it is by Schiſm ſeparated from the great Catholick Body of Chriſtians, to be Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform and Principled; whereas by them, it is clearly Negative, Confuſive, and Begs the queſtion in the root of all. Briefly thus: As for the first, the Dr aims directly, at the ſubverſion of all traditional Revelation, and of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal viſible and infallible proponent of divine credibles, and of all power obligeing to accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them as ſuch and conſequently, at the overthrow of all Articles, by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> allowed and Canonized as truths reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thoſe grounds. As for the next his Canons for the interpreting Gods written Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, are of that Latitude, that whoever admits them, if he pleaſe, may diſagree with the
<pb facs="tcp:57867:7"/>Doctor and all others, and with himſelf too, at different times, by virtue of a pretended Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal infallible-all-truth diſcerning-faculty which he allows all, in all fundamentals and ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures depending on the controverted ſenſe of Gods written Word, after a ſober enquiry and ſincere endeavours; however neceſſary thoſe credibles be to ſalvation, or the framing one Church of many truth-diſcerning members; whether this their enquiry be performed by the working of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only, which in ſupernatural Truths, revives Pelagianiſm; or by a pretended perſonal divine aſſiſtance, in regard of each Believer; to which every one may as legally pretend, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it to himſelf, by pretence of having uſed his beſt means to underſtand Scripture, as the Dr. himſelf, or any other Teacher, which is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect an Acephalick Enthuſiaſm or Fanaticiſm. And as for the laſt, if it be a legal proof, that there is no traditional Revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that God has uſed fraud, or that his ſcribes have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere with us, becauſe there are ſome divine Revelations written; or again, that there is no external infallible proponent or obliging Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as to matter of faith and manners, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe every one is an infallible propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to himſelf, and can uſe his beſt endeavours to diſcern the true ſenſe of Scripture in neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or alſo that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, nor any

            <p>But I purpoſe not here Sir to give you a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial report either of the Drs. account of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, or of his Principles of his own, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending not to exceed the limits of a prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Epiſtle, or to foreſtall your <hi>TO KATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIKO,</hi> or the labours of others, who have already entred the field, or perhaps will hereafter appear there, to help on the Doctors Itch of writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or for his own (as he makes it his Profeſſion) though to as little purpoſe as if he had forbid his beard to grow, or the Sun to walk his uſual rounds, for God will preſerve the work of his own hands ſhould the Dr. ſcribble or babble till his dooms-day.

            <p>Now Sir, as for any Anſwer to theſe our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply's, you muſt be ſure to arm your ſelf, with a large ſtore of Reſignation; either to be told by the Doctor, of his many more important employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments abroad, and neceſsary Occupations at home for propagating the Goſpel; or to hear of ſome new diſperate Piece againſt Popery, which ſome conſiderable Perſon expects from him; or that he is ſick of ſome diſeaſe, much like <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Quinſie; for 'tis uſual with Perſons of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, in this caſe, ſtill to anſwer beſides the purpoſe; nor to heed whatever has been often ſaid unto them; but ever to crow and caper, as if each of them were a Conqueror, ſo true is it, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou ſhouldeſt bray a Fool in a Morter, amongſt Wheat with a Peſtell, yet will not his fooliſhneſs depart from Him.

            </head>
            <p>THe Book, Sir, which taken up with better affairs, you ſent unto me, that I might, after I had read it over, draw an Abridgment of it for you, with my own thoughts ſuper-added in the cloſe, by way of a ſhort Comment thereon, is the ſecond production as it ſeems, of Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> againſt Popery. Leſs diſpleaſing it is I think to a Reader, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo tireſome, as ſome other Books which have iſſued forth on that Side againſt the ways of Catholick Religion. For there is ſome Truth in his Citations, a ſeaſoning of Salt and comical Wittineſs ſprinkled all over; and no ſuch thick groſs venom of maliciouſneſs, wherewith other Books of that kind are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, appearing, though much of it lie hid, throughout his Book. Indeed he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts all things by his various ſubtilty: But that is no more, but what his own fame and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57867:11"/>intereſt, here principally aimed at, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And we muſt give him leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride alſo, and play and ſport himſelf in his Book, as a Leviathan in his own waters. It is his paſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue and pleaſure, and a ſweetneſs eſteemed perhaps neceſſary to his life. And who would be ſo ill-natur'd as to envy it him? Beſides, it is a pretty piece of Rhetorick, both fit and very efficacious to create in his Proteſtant Readers an opinion of his uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring confidence, which is the one great end of his Labours. And if we be thus kind, he will, in recompence of that our civility, give leave I ſuppoſe to Catholicks, who ſee him ſo jocund and ſupinely careleſs in his errors, thence to conclude the ſtrange inconſiderate ſecurity of the merry man.</p>
            <p>But we muſt know, Sir, that this his elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Book againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he ſpeaks, although it be his ſecond, yet is it not intended to be his laſt: For, <hi>If Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have any thing to ſay,</hi> quoth he, <hi>either againſt our Church, or in defence of their own, let them come into the open Field, from whence they have of late ſo wiſely withdrawn themſelvs, finding ſo little ſucceſs in it.</hi> Thus he ſpeaks in his Preface, threatning (if I underſtand him right) another Knocker, as ſtout a one as this can be, if any one dare to appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, or ſay ſo much as <hi>Boh</hi> to a Gooſe.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57867:11"/>And theſe words of his, import I think a Challenge, called commonly a Defiance; which Catholicks as ſoon as they had read, thought it as much their duty, as it ſounded to be the Doctors deſire, to fit their Slings unto their Arms, and meet him. But the thing proved alas to be but a Copy of the Doctors Countenance, quite differing from his heart. For the Preſſes, guarded enough before againſt Catholicks, was preſently within a month after his Book came forth, ſo ſtoutly beſet, ſo frequently invaded, ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſearched night and day, eſpecially by the induſtry of one of them, who entring into the Printing-houſes, cried out aloud, <hi>And what! have ye here any thing againſt the Doctor Stilling fleet? hah!</hi> that what before was difficil, and extreamly dangerous, was now become impoſſible. So that I believe no Catholick in <hi>England</hi> can do him the favour which the Doctor thirſts after ſo earneſtly in his Lips. He challenged the Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſts for his Credit, and ſtopt up their way for his Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: He would firſt make the world believe they cannot anſwer him, and then provides that they ſhall not. This ſeems to be his mind.</p>
            <p>And yet I think, Sir, there be few Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi> who deſire not as earneſtly as any Catholick, to ſee ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57867:12"/>to his Book: So little do they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned in a Scroll which neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends their Religion, nor hurts or touches ours; wherein nothing is ſaid, but what might as well be ſpoken by a <hi>Mahomet an, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan;</hi> and the moſt part of that which is put to diſable Catholick Religion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes Chriſtianity it ſelf. Some of them offered themſelves to print a Reply for us: But they offered but words. For they found that the Biſhop durſt not give a Licenſe to any of our Catholick Books, onely ſo far as to ſecure the Printer from danger; although the Doctor be a Foe to their Rank and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Catholick Religion a Friend. This is, truly Sir, a very ſad caſe, that they can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give one a Licenſe to defame men, and yet dare not give others a Licenſe to clear themſelves. Doctor <hi>Couſins</hi> when he was in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſpake up and down ſo freely againſt Catholick Religion that their Clergy hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it came to him, and told him plainly, <hi>That if he had ought to ſay againſt their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they would both get him a Licenſe from the Biſhop to print his Book, and themſelves pay the whole charges, and then anſwer him when they had done, for his ſatisfaction.</hi> But we poor Creatures can obtain no favour in our own Countrey, no leave to ſpeak or juſtifie our ſelves, no Licenſe to print a Book for our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57867:12"/>defence, when we are both ſcurrilouſly libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and falſely ſlandered, and imperiouſly challenged to anſwer: Nor is there any open field for our poor Men to come forth into, that I know of, but <hi>Tybourn;</hi> and that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Doctor's meaning. It does mightily amaze our Catholicks all over the Land, to have their Ears thus beaten with ſlanders, which are both of a high nature, and ſtill notoriouſly falſe, year by year, without any end; thereby to make us odious to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and them to God. Our bleſſed Lord have pity on us; and either open, if it may be thy will, our Magiſtrates hearts towards us, or ſtop the Miniſters mouths againſt us; that our good Name and Peace may return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy great Glory. We are, if we be ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent, proclaimed guilty: and if we ſpeak, inſolent. What can we do, Sir, here, but ſtill commend our ſelves unto our heavenly Lord, who mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly preſerves us. We do either ſubſiſt after this life, or not. Our Proteſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men muſt needs believe one of theſe two things: Either ſome Religion is true, or it is all a fiction. If it be all a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fiction, and there is no life to come, then are they as guilty as we; nay, ſomething more; for they have taken away our Churches from us, for themſelves to diſſemble in. If there be a life to come, and this everlaſting, then can there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57867:13"/>certainly be nothing of greater importance in this world, than to know, when many ways are pretended to it, which of them is the moſt authentick and trueſt, wherein we may be both happy and ſafe for ever. Why then are we, who are the firſt not permitted to ſpeak, while all others are permitted to blaſpheme us? If we prove to go amiſs, the danger is our own: and if we be in the right, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any danger unto them to know it. All the poſitive things of Religion which any of them do keep, they have them all from us, we borrow nothing from them. And the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive points which ſeparate them from us, ſeem to us as falſe and impious, as they can poſſibly appear true to them. They have as many Articles to believe as we, only ſome of them which made the ſeparation are affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to us, and negative to them: And one Affirmers word is to be taken in Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ten Deniers. And yet will they neither read our Books, nor ſuffer us to print any, when we are falſified, and miſ-interpreted, and challenged and obliged to do it, for fear I think our Religion ſhould prove true. All rejoyce when a Book is written againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but no man ſeeks to be informed. They will have it by all means to be eſteemed falſe, be it in it ſelf what it will or can be. And in that ſtrange prejudice men venture to die,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57867:13"/>onely for the pleaſure of a Miniſter and his Wife and Children, who muſt needs have it ſo.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of this his preſent book, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the Idolatry,</hi> &amp;c. was, it ſeems, a queſtion or two propounded unto Mr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> by I know not what Gentlewoman, who having heard the Doctor ſay, That <hi>Proteſtants if they turned Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, would loſe their Salvation;</hi> told him, That if Proteſtants ſay ſo, then are they full as uncharitable as Papiſts themſelves, who aver the like of Proteſtants: She therefore conſults ſome Catholick Gentleman in the buſineſs; I do not know whom neither. But he, it ſeems put into her hand two queſtions, to ſhow to Doctor <hi>Still,</hi> in her next encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Yet here we may take notice that the ſaid Reſolution of his, is quite contrary both to a book of his called <hi>Irenicon,</hi> written in the times of our late Anarchy, and alſo to his firſt work written more lately againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. For all the whole ſcope of both theſe books, is to ſhow that a Chriſtian by vertue of his being ſo, is not bound to joyn in the Communion of any one Church in particular, or any Organical Body, as he calls it. And that becauſe every ſuch body, either that is or has been in the World, is liable to errour, falſhood, and corruptions. And what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eed can there be in me to joyn in any Communion, which may go aſtray and miſlead me, ſince I cannot do worſe if I remain free and all alone, and may perhaps do better? But theſe contradictions are ſmall matters. So long as the Doctor oppoſes the Catholick Church, out of which they are all fallen, he is a Proteſtant good enough, whatever he hold in particular, either contrary to himſelf or any others.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion, which is the occaſion and ſubject of this his preſent book he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves negatively; averring, <hi>that the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which might ſecure one born and bred in the Catholick Church to continue in it, cannot ſecure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57867:14"/>a Proteſtant, convinced by them to imbrace it.</hi> And this his Aſſertion he diſcourſes at large, and confirms by various Syllogiſmes; becauſe invincible hinderance may perhaps excuſe the one, but not the other: becauſe the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is ſafe in his own Church, and therefore has no neceſſity to leave it: becauſe there is imminent danger in the Roman Church; where there is ſo much Idolatry, ſo many hinderances of good life and devotion, ſo much diviſions, ſo much uncertainty of faith in it. Unto theſe reſolutions and argumentations of his, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Propoſer adjoyned preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y his own reply, a very rational me thinks and good one. Hereupon the Doctor wrote and ſet forth this his preſent book, called <hi>A Diſcourſe againſt the Idolatry, &amp;c.</hi> both to inlarge his own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to diſable the Catholick Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Reply. And this was the occaſion, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſubject of the book you put in my hand to peruſe, and write to you the ſubſtance of it, with ſome few brief thoughts of my own upon it.</p>
            <p>Indeed the whole book is a kind of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Act or Commencement: ſuch a one as we have once a year in our famous <hi>Oxford</hi> &amp; <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> written and printed for peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligh: and paſtime; and if ſo it pleaſe the Stars, for his own honour and preferment by our Doctor.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57867:15"/>about a fortnight before the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act. to ſave the wits living here abouts, the great charges and ſome kind of pains of a Journey thither, being now furniſhed well enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with as ſubtile and good an Act, as that may haply be, at our own doors, and which may pleaſe the Women ſomewhat better, in our Mother tongue.</p>
            <p>The concluſions defended in this <hi>Holborn</hi> Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are theſe three.

What is it, that wit and induſtry cannot bring to light, if they be joyntly bent both of them upon the ſearch? And a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery eſpecially of a rich pleaſant <hi>Country</hi> ful of curioſities is ſo pleaſant to the Diſcoverer himſelf, ſo naturally pleaſant that I cannot but think that D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> at his invention of <hi>Fanaticiſme,</hi> wherewith he hoped to make many others merry, laughed heartily himſelf.</p>
            <p>He begins his Book with the <hi>Roman</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: and he does wiſely in it. For Idolatry is ſuch a terrible thundering charge; that in all <hi>Readers</hi> judgments that <hi>Church</hi> is half condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already, which hath that crime ſo much as laid upon it. Men therfore chooſe rather to be accounted Atheiſts than Idolaters. For the firſt argues wit, with other ſtupidity. Nor will one man of a hundred trouble himſelf to read over a Book written on any purpoſe of clearing from that enormous crime either himſelf or religion profeſſed by the Author of it. Be the imputation never ſo falſe, yet is it ſtil ablaſting imputation; which kills and overthrows, not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57867:16"/>ſo much by proving as by naming it. He muſt needs be impious who is an Idolater; and he muſt be an Idolater who is called ſo. Be it never ſo unjuſt, it is ſtill a witty trick to cry out againſt him as an Idolater, whoſe honour and livelihood we would here in <hi>England</hi> undermine. Sad experience has proved this to be true too too often. And the Great God of Heavens anger lies I fear heavily upon us for it. This thus far. Now forward.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Church of Rome worſhips God by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and is therefore guilty of Idolatry by giving to the Creature the worſhip due only to the Creator. For God having forbidden any ſuch ſort of worſhiping him by his own law and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments given by Moſes, wherein he forbids his people to make day kind of image,</hi> peſel the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munah eikon glyp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the reaſon of that law of Moſes is unchangeable, which is that God's infinite and incomprehenſible Deity cannot be repreſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d For which reaſon the wiſeſt of Heathen both particular Men and Nations judged all ſuch repreſentations of the inviſible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57867:16"/>Godhead to be incongruous and unbecoming his glory; And if this were inconſiſtent with Gods nature and will in the old Law much more in the new, where we are taught to worſhip God in ſpirit and truth, and to have no low unworthy thought of God. It might therefore ſeem more rational to worſhip God in the Sun, and Moon, which have more of God in them, and to ſay our prayers to the Sun and Moon them to any image or ſhadow; the ſame argument which excuſes the one will juſtifie the other much more. For this reaſon St. Paul teaches that the Godhead is not like to gold or ſilver or ſtone, and blames thoſe who change the glory of the incorruptible God into the image of corruptible man. And the Heathens in doing this did ill: although the wiſer ſort among them teſtifie that they did not hold their ſtatues to be Gods, but that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God in them. And yet ſome antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſputed notwithſtanding againſt that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then practice, and counted it idolatry. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Germanus <hi>Patriark of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>ſays expreſly that Chriſtians make no repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the inviſible Deity; and</hi> Damaſcene <hi>that it is madneſs to go about it. Wherefore the Synode of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>and that of</hi> Frankford <hi>pleaded hard againſt the making of any images amongſt Chriſtians however the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Council of</hi> Nice <hi>vainly went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them as innocent and uſeful helps. Finally,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57867:17"/>Moſes himſelf explicates by his deeds the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own Law when he was ſo highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with Aaron for the golden Calf he had made the people in his abſence. And yet Aaron did not make it to bring the people into heathen idolatry, but to give them only a Symbole of the Angel who was to go before the people: As alſo the two Calves ſet up by Jeroboam in Dan and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel were ſet up only to keep the people from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Jeruſalem, and not to bring them to the idolatry of heathens. And therefore Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians never uſed any images, as the learned of the Church of Rome acknowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 1. This is the ſum of the Doctors diſcourſe in this his firſt Chapter. And he cannot but expect his Reader ſhould have a mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of either his moſt high or moſt deep Divinity, who hath converſt ſo much with the learned ſort of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the graver ſort of Philoſophers, and wiſer ſort of Heathens. Nothing does he here deliver, that was ſo much as thought of by the common ſort, the vulgar ſort, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſort of Mankind. And O what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and content of heart will it be unto him, if he could meet with an adverſary of his <hi>learned ſort</hi> too, who viewing his airy ſubtilties ſhould oppoſe him ſeriouſly, as if he were ſerious himſelf; and then diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh as if he were dealing with ſome ſolid
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57867:17"/>Divine; and then ply him with proofs and teſtimonies, refell him by ſhorter enthymems and longer ſyllogiſmes; ſubtilly ſearch in what Mood and Figure he ſpeaks; and then tell him how his conſequence flaggs, or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is ambiguous, till he have learnedly conſumed a hundred pages in refutation of a trifle. Then ſurely will the Doctour be judged by all parties to be as he would be thought to be, an able man.</p>
               <p>§ 2. The Catholick Church uſes indeed both in their publick and private oratories, ſome pious repreſentations of our holy Lord, either in his paſſion, or birth, reſurrection, or aſcention, or miraculous working of ſome divine miracle: And theſe holy figures of his are accompanied commonly with ſome others of his bleſſed Virgin Mother, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Apoſtles, valorous Martyrs, holy Confeſſors, chaſt Virgins, or other happy followers of our Lord, who through many tribulations and a conſtant exerciſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vertues have paſſed hence to a bleſſed life. All which do mightily avail, unto our retiredneſs and recollection; when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the houſe of prayer, a holy place ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and ſanctified for Gods ſervice, from our own houſes or the ſtreets. And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or eſteem we have for ſuch figures, is nothing but what we bear either unto the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57867:18"/>hiſtories recorded of the ſame Perſons, or to thoſe good rules of life and promiſes of Goſpel, which thoſe Worthies have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, for the incouragement and imitation of us, who are now ſtrugling in that wicked world, which they overcame before us. For example, as we reverence the hiſtory of Chriſts incarnation, ſounding in our ear; ſo do we look upon the figure of it r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>eſented to our eye: As we love the ſtory of St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalens converſion; ſo do we like her Picture. As we honour St. Pauls life and Martyrdome; ſo do we reſpect his Image. And St. Lawrences moſt cruel paſſion upon the hot burning Gridiron, when it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us in a Pict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re, we are in the ſelf ſame manner affected towards it, as we are to the invincible vertue and patience there ſhown for the Love and honour of Jeſus our Lord, whoſe ſteps he followed. So that, what authentick hiſtory records to us in words, of the vertue and valour of any of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Anceſtors; or what holy Goſpel tells us, of the glory and crown to be rendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good works of ſobriety, charity, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, purity, patience, and the like: the ſame is without words painted unto us by theſe compendious hieroglyphicks, ſerving more ſpeedily than words can do, to faſten us unto a ſtrict recollection in our Prayers
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57867:18"/>by one ſhort glance about us; and to a fear and awfulneſs of Gods preſence in that place where we are met together for his Service, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſigures of ſo many of our pious Anceſtours who are gone to Heaven before us; and alſo to a diſſipation of any worldly thoughts, that may, as they are apt enough to do, at that time come along with us there unto our hinderance. All this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit we have by our Pictures, when we have haply no book to look upon, or know not by our ignorance to read, or cannot by darkneſs or other lettance attend unto that labour. And this is all the whole buſineſs of Images, as to Religion. In the Road of Philoſophy trodden by School-Divines, where thouſands of concluſions over and above faith are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and oppoſed by one another unto the ſharpning of their wits, many things are ſaid about every thing, as the creation, reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the like, which faith in the ſame things is ſilent of; Nor are we in our defence of faith concerned at all in them. And it may be eaſily diſcerned by our Catholick practice what uſe we make of our Images, when of a hundred people entring into a Church, nor one of them ever caſts his eye wiſtly upon them, but contented with a general glance, compoſe themſelves preſently unto their prayers and meditations they keep ſilently in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57867:19"/>ſpirit towards God. And when our Pictures are ſo ſullied and ſpoiled, that they will no more ſerve our uſe, we put them into the fire, as we would do alſo a page of ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures uttterly obliterated and fouled.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Indeed all the whole buſineſs of the uſe of Images at all, is but a matter of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and government, for the help of people in the great work of recollection and prayer; as is the uſe of Churches, and the muſick uſed in them, with the Harp, Viol, &amp; other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Uſe of Beads and Prayer-books. All which our Religion could ſpare, and yet be not at all impaired, as to any its eſſential or ſubſtantial parts. Nay there be inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences in any one of theſe things. Nor do I know any good thing in this world without ſome inconvenience or other. It is enough for us, that the conveniences and benefits of any good we have or uſe, are more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the inconveniences be. Many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Prelates in Chriſtianity have at times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted very ſtrongly againſt Organs, as ſome hindrance of the great work of ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation which Chriſtian people meet to practice together in their holy Aſſemblies, the great paramount work of Chriſtianity, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at Maſs. But theſe men, although mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto that their exception by a Zeal not evil, yet were they fain to yield at laſt unto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57867:19"/>the prevaling reaſons of other Prelates which over bore their leſſer ones. Some other of our Catholick Doctors and Prelates would have had us to have uſed no Pictures; that Jews and Pagans might not catch at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to cavil againſt our Chriſtianity as they did. But all theſe ſubmitted at laſt, unto the prevailing part; by whom they were made to underſtand that the inconveniences they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged were but imaginary and ſmall, the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences great and real. There have been not a few who have excepted againſt much vocal Prayer; becauſe it took up too much of the time which would be better employed in the more principal work of prayer in ſpirit. But yet could they not carry it, although their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were very plauſible and good; becauſe that high and Angelical prayer in ſpirit, agreed not equally to all men, or to any one conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fleſh and blood equally at all times and places, as vocal prayer does. Some have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked even our material Temples, built up ſo ſumptuouſly as they are; becauſe God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and incomprehenſible, dwells not in buildings made by mans hands; Heaven is his Seat, and Earth his Footſtool; Yet could they not obtain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our Churches ſhould be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pulled down, or not built up. Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books were nothing at all in uſe amongſt Chriſtians in primitive times; when they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57867:20"/>almoſt altogether in ſpirit, and uſed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vocal prayer but that our Lord taught us. And yet this hinders us not, either to make ſuch books, or uſe them in following times. Inſtead of our beads in wood or mettal, they uſed in ancient times a bag of little ſtones, by the emptying whereof they knew that they had ſaid over our Lords prayer a hundred or perhaps three hundred times, according as any one in his devotion had prefixed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf every day of his life to do for Gods glory and ſervice. And there might be inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences pretended againſt our preſent heads, eſpecially thoſe of gold and pearl. But they will not be thrown away for that. Our Church-muſick has been more than once op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and that by Prelates moſt holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned men, who deemed it an unſufferable lettance to the ſpiritual recollection which Chriſtians ought above all things to a tend unto, that they may have our Lords good Spirit, and his holy operations in them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they meet together at their holy Synaxis. But Church-muſick is kept up to this day, notwithſtanding their reaſon againſt it, which is very good, for other reaſons no leſs good and great than it; ſpecified and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the far greater number of pious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates for it. And yet if all or the greater part of Catholick Prelates meeting together
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57867:20"/>ſhould take away all theſe outward helps from us, beads and books, ſinging and Church-mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, pictures, and Churches, and all, finding the inconveniences to be now greater than they have been, and weightier than any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience we have by them: though the thing would ſeem very ſtrange to us, yet ought we I think to obey them reſignedly, and attend wholly unto our ſpiritual meditations, either alone, or in our Euchariſtian meetings, and to the other good works commanded orcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled us in Goſpel, in expectation of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bliſs and eternal happineſs in God, which can never be taken from us: though all things of diſcipline or helps in government be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>§ 4. And now it is time to turn back and view the ſubject of this Chapter; that we may ſee if any one period in it be true and pertinent. He tells us firſt, that Papiſts <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God by Images,</hi> which logically is not true; Then <hi>that a repreſentation of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deity cannot be made;</hi> which is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; Then <hi>that the worſhip given to God by an Image does not terminate upon God:</hi> which is neither pertinent nor true. And ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds on to the very end of his Chapter, with ſounds either empty or falſe, or both; neither heeding or caring what he ſays, ſo he do but mention learned Papiſts, and wiſer Heathens,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57867:21"/>which may help to butterreſs up his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I cannot but remember here, the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or Ghoſt in Virgil which Juno made of Aeneas, to draw her beloved Turnus out of the field; It ſeemed to fight and threaten, and preſs on, and give back. But nothing at all was done really.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57867:22"/>of Bethel among us. Catholick Pictures are againſt Moſes his Law; but theirs are not ſo; Although they be repreſentations both in Heaven above and Earth below, and Waters under earth, expreſly by the ſame Law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; for example, Moon and Stars Dogs and Cats, Whales and Dolphins. The Picture of Martin Luther in their Chamber is the lawful effigies of a man. But Saint Stephen in our Cloſet is a Calf.

For they no other way worſhip God by Images: This is the mortal ſin which Catholicks commit. And if that illogical ſpeech of the Doctor, <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks worſhip God by Images,</hi> be drawn into any kind of ſence, it can be no other than this, that Catholicks take occaſion by the pious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Martyrs to think of Gods mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold graces and mercies towards them, and thereupon truſt in him afreſh and bleſs his name: which great errour the Doctor, it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57867:22"/>ſeems, does carefully avoid. The ancient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians thought of God and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him by any thing any good thing they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed; the verdant fields and ſweet flowers, comfortable air, and pleaſing light, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, valleys and liquid ſtreams; Plumbs, Pears, Apples, and chearful Grapes; by the vertue, charity and devotion of men, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now we muſt take heed of that.

They are never taught in any of their Catechiſms to worſhip God by Images. None of their ſpiritual books wherein all religious Duties are importunately urged and preſſed upon them ever mention it: and their practice does not infer it. For if it did, they would eaſilieſt underſtand it who beſt know what themſelves do. They are taught, and do in their practice endeavour to worſhip God in their heart and ſoul, and ardent affections ſtreaming forth thence towards him. They worſhip him with bended knees, lips &amp; voice, hearts and eyes lifted up unto him. They worſhip him with the aſſiſtance of Gods good Spirit, the Prieſts Sacrifice, and help of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Prayers. They worſhip him by mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſenſuality and carnal appetites, by giving alms and relieving the poor and needy for his Love, by obſerving his Laws and Counſels, by reſigning to his good will and plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57867:24"/>name ſake patiently. They worſhip him in Cloſets, in Church-aſſemblies, in the fields, as they are walking, on Land or Sea, where they have oppportunity to do it. Thus doth their religion teach them to worſhip God, as with the right cauſes and inſtruments; as by the true effects and operations; as in the times and places ſeaſonable for worſhip and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how they ſhould <hi>worſhip God by images,</hi> or (as he ſpeaketh oftner in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of his diſcourſe) <hi>in images;</hi> this they do not eaſily underſtand. When he lays any thing to Catholicks charge, he ought to ſpeak I ſhould think as Catholicks do, and then he will be underſtood by them. It is not to be conceived how any one can worſhip God <hi>by images,</hi> and <hi>in images,</hi> but either for the real preſence there; or ideal imitation; or ſome ſort of occaſion of worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>p ariſing thence. And ſo God muſt be worſhipped by them and in them, either preſentially, ideally, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally. And it cannot be preſentially. For ſo God is no otherwiſe preſent in a picture than in the wall it hangs upon: nor yet ideally; for the picture for example of St. Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen or St. Paul, is no idea of that inviſible and glorious Godhead; nor yet is any other, as the Crucifix for example or Chriſt our Lord in his Birth or Reſurrection; for all theſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are repreſentations of his humanity, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57867:25"/>no idea's of his Deity at all. And Mr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet muſt needs mean one of theſe two ways. For otherwiſe he could not charge them with idolatry for it. And therefore I ſay that his charge is falſe and ſlanderous. But if he mean that they worſhip God by images &amp; in their images, occaſionally; which is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral interpretation, and the only true one: Then is ſuch a work ſo far from Idolatry, that it is a ſublime piety. For what can they better do, then to give God thanks for ſo great graces, mercies, helps, and comforts beſtowed in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord upon his Apoſtles. Martyrs, Confeſſors, and Virgins, when they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Figures and Pictures either in their contemplations, or patience of Martyrdome, or converſion of the world, ſubduing and bringing fleſh, Satan and the World under their ſeet: eſpecially if Catholicks conceive thereby ſome pious reſolution, as well they may, of doing ſomething the more and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſuffering for God, in imitation of thoſe pious Heroes our Predeceſſours in Religion, and yet naturally but fleſh and blood as we our ſelves are. I ſay all this is ſignal piety, and our Chriſtian duty. And according to this morall meaning Catholicks if they do worſhip God by their Images, and in their Images; do well, and like good Chriſtians. But the Doctor will not charge them I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57867:25"/>with a matter of ſo much truth and great piety as this is, although his words cannot make out any other ſence that is true, but only this morall one. And the more logical ſence of worſhipping God by images, and in images; ideally or preſentially is falſe. Let him even take wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch ſence he pleaſes, either what juſtifies Catholicks or what falſifies his own aſſertion; It is all one to me, whether we ſtand, or he fall.</p>
               <p>§ 6. He adds, <hi>That the worſhip of God by Images does not terminate upon God; becauſe God has forbid it, and ſo gives Gods honor to the Creature.</hi> This is ſtrange gibberiſh. An act that tends to nothing is no act. If it be ſome act, it tends and has already tended to ſomething; and it terminates upon that thing unto which it tends, and whoſe act it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated. This is clear enough even to a young ſophomore, or one who indeed never yet came into the Air of Philoſophy, if he do but underſtand the terms and words here uſed. For example, I cannot ſee a man in the ſtreet, except my viſion terminate upon him; nor can my viſion terminate upon him, but I muſt ſee him. And it is all one whether I ſee him cloſe by me, or by my Window, or in a Looking-glaſs at home. For I cannot ſee him any way, but my ſight muſt terminate upon him, and if it do not, I ſee him not. And
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57867:26"/>this courſe of nature is not hindred, nor yet altered at all, becauſe that Perſon may haply have forbidden me to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, either this way or that. For our acts or actions are accompliſhed within our ſelves, independently of any acceptance or diſacceptance of them. Acceptance or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſacceptance, commanding or forbidding is another thing, extrinſecal and quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſubſtance of the act or action. For they ſpecifie onely, either the motive or event which may make the act either good or evil, either grateful or diſpleaſing, but not make it an act or no act, or not to tend where it has tended. And ſo muſt my act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God by images, terminate upon God, or elſe it is no act of worſhipping God by them; however God may have either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbid it. God has forbidden blaſphemy; and yet the act terminates upon him, otherwiſe it could not be a ſin againſt him. And if Gods worſhip by Images do not terminate on God, whither on Gods name does it tend; and how is God worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them? This he does not tell us here, unleſs he inſinuate it in thoſe following words o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57867:26"/>but the tube only, or ſhould not our ſight then be terminated upon the Star. So it ſeems by this Doctors philoſophy, who hath converſed with the learneder ſort of Papiſts, and the wiſer ſort of heathens, but very little with himſelf. Holy Fathers and Doctors have often ſaid, that the honour of an Image re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Prototype: but never thought or ſaid, that the honour of the Prototype re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Image, as it is here affirmed againſt both art and experience. But let us hear him proceed in his diſcourſe. He will ſurely let fall ſome ſence or truth ere long.</p>
               <p>§ 7. <hi>Gods infinite and incomprehenſible Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaith he, cannot be repreſented.</hi> O here it is. This is very true. What a comfortable thing it is to meet with a draught of truth ſometimes, when a man is dry and thirſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. But to what purpoſe is this ſpoken here? Catholicks have no repreſentations of that inviſible Deity, nor none they look after. Figures they have of our Lord Chriſt, born as man amongſt us and made fleſh, and crucified, and aſcending into Heaven. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures alſo of his holy Followers and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: but repreſentations of the inviſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify they never yet ſaw nor heard nor thought of. On then. <hi>The wiſeſt of Heathens judged any ſuch repreſentations of the Divine nature incongruous and unbecoming his glory,</hi> Indeed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57867:27"/>they were wiſe heathens, and their judgment very right and good. Nor did I ever hear of any Chriſtian wiſe or unwiſe any otherwiſe minded: O how would this Doctor prevail, if this wiſe Diſcourſe of his, were as perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as it is true. But he truſts and hopes well, that his good fate will ſo accompany his Reader, that he ſhall not doubt at all that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that is true in his book is alſo to ſome purpoſe. And to ſome purpoſe indeed it is: namely to have it thought, that he is victorious in his main deſign: although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and truth it belong nothing at all to it. But let me not ſtop his carreere. <hi>If any ſuch figure of the Deity were inconſiſtent in the old Law much more in the new where we are commanded to worſhip God in ſpirit and truth.</hi> O uncontroulable conſequence, ariſing from premiſſes moſt true. No man can or dare deny all this. Methinks I love him here for his reaſon, and cannot but grieve it ſhould be all ſpilt in vain; ſo pure it is and precious. A little more of this, while he is in a good mood. <hi>It ſeems more rational to worſhip God in the Sun and Moon which have more of God in them than a Picture has, and to ſay our prayers to the Sun and Moon than to any Image.</hi> Seems ſo Sir? It is certainly more rational: what ſhould we doubt of? And what a pitty is it, there ſhould be none to be found, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57867:27"/>God in a Picture either ideally or preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; none who ſay their prayers to a picture that this great blow of his might not beat the Aire to the indangering of his elbows. Saint <hi>Paul teſtifies that the Godhead is not like either to gold or ſilver or ſtone.</hi> Good St. Paul always ſaid well; and his teſtimony is good at all times; and eſpecially now, when it hits ſo pat with the wiſer Heathens. There be many Churches now in England which have ſince our reformation, the Tetragram name of God written upon the walls within ſide in golden letters. Unto thoſe men who did this, it would not ſeem altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, to tell them, that <hi>the Godhead is not like to gold, ſilver or ſtone.</hi> But to ſuch as uſe only the effigies of our Lord according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and his holy Apoſtles and Martyrs, what a pitty it is it ſhould be impertinent and wholly loſt.

But he means Catholick people perhaps, oh, O, then all is well, they are ſafe enough and unhurt by all this, which is but their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and faith.

And yet muſt ſtill this Law be caſt in the teeth of Catholicks as tranſgreſſors of it. For Gods ſake why is St. Mary Magdalen in her penitential weeds upon her knees, with beads in her hand, and eyes all blubbered and ſwoln with tears, more againſt the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> than one of our delicate Paragons of beauty, in her ſhining dreſs, lips of coral and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eyes, <hi>O but Catholicks worſhip them.</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57867:29"/>this word in the ſenſe and meaning of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants is as great a falſhood as was ever ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by man. For Catholicks neither have nor can have any other relative eſteem of any Picture, than what they have to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential works they repreſent, or to the worth and piety of the Perſons. And an abſolute eſteem of the Picture, this is meaſured out only by the Materials, and artifice of the Painter; according to which one Picture ſhall be worth five hundred pounds, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repreſenting the ſame thing, not worth five ſhillings. And can we believe that our Proteſtant young Gentlemen have no vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at all to our beauties ſet thus in their Majeſty, nor no kind of affections riſing in their hearts towards them? Yea ten to one more of ill affections, and god wot greater, then any good ones we can have to our cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſied Jeſus in our way of piety. And the difference indeed is only this, that our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and affection is towards holy perſons, and unto an imitation of their piety, hope, patience, conſtancy, and charity: Their's to a concupiſcence of fleſh and eyes. This and nothing but this if truth may be ſpoken, makes them ſo wrathful and furious againſt our Catholick pictures. Satan hates Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore inflames them to tear down his memories and repreſentations: but he loves pride of life; and thoſe portractures
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57867:29"/>muſt ſtand that advance this. He is pleaſed with that which feeds concupiſcence of eyes: and concupiſcence of fleſh brings him in the diſciples which Jeſus Chriſt loſes.</p>
               <p>Moſes did forbid Jews who were travelling with him towards Paleſtine and idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make to <hi>themſelves,</hi> that is to ſay on their own heads, without warrant of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, or in imitation of the Pagan rites, any of the idolatrous images there and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be met withal, or any ſimilitude at all, leaſt ſeduced thereby, they leave their own God and religion to cleave unto falſe gods and idolatry. This law of Moſes and purpoſe of the law is ſo clear, that he muſt be obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind who ſees it not. And what does this concern our holy Catholick figures of St. Paul for example or Chriſt crucified, more than Proteſtant ſigures of young Lords and fine Ladies; ſave that the one moves us to the love of moritification, prayer, patience, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, the other allures us from it; the one confirms Religion, the other weakens it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our holy Pictures are allowed by the Church, the others forbidden And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the only aim of Moſes, when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the people to make to <hi>themſelves</hi> any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven images whatſoever; to <hi>themſelves,</hi> that is on their own fancies, and upon their own authority: For ſuch only were unlawful, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57867:30"/>not thoſe they were commanded by juſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and allowed to make. See, ſaith God by Moſes, I have called and named Beſaleel, and I have filled him with the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, and all knowledge of all amnner of workmanſhip, to deviſe cunning works to work in gold and ſilver and braſs, and in cutting of ſtones and in graving of wood, to work all manner of workmanſhip. And I have appointed Aholiab with him; and in the hearts of all the wiſe I have put wiſdom, that they make all that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And by virtue whereof the ſaid men and others after them move and graved pomgranets and lilies, and placed Cherubs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Propitiatory, between which graven Cherubims God himſelf gave out his Oracles to Moſes: as he did a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that here is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt figures graven and ſet up by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and thoſe which People make to themſelves. The one is commanded, the other forbidden. Aaron's Calf of gold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the people, but Moſes his Serpent of braſs healed them. Theſe things are not now ſaid afreſh. They have been told to Miniſters over and again, but they are never the better for it. Indeed they love not to hear of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpoils their ſport.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57867:30"/>
               <p>I add yet withal, over and above what is yet ſaid, that neither that law of Moſes, nor any of his Ten Commandments, nor any other of his Precepts, either ceremonial, judicial or moral, does any way oblige Chriſtians at all, as it comes from Moſes, who is not our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker or maſter, but ruler and leader of the Jews. Nor do we Chriſtians believe that theft, adultery, homicide or blaſphemy, is a ſin, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> for bad it, but becauſe we have receiv'd from Jeſus our own Leg ſlator who juſtified <hi>Moſes</hi> law and ratified it in all the ſaid particulars, that ſo it is. And it is here to be obſerved that one of the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn laws contained in thoſe two tables, that I mean, which ordains the ſeventh day to be kept holy day, unto which <hi>Moſes</hi> adjoyns an irrefragable and unchangeable reaſon, namely becauſe God reſted that day when he made this viſible world, beginning his work ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> on the Sunday wherin he created light, and the Friday following finiſhing the whole; even this law of his moſt ſolemn and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely urged by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is annulled and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the ſame thing do <hi>I</hi> ſay of this his preſent Law about figures, images and repreſentations of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57867:31"/>things by ſculpture or pencil, which was only of temporal concernment to the then preſent Jews, againſt the danger of idols, which then filled the earth, and as meer a ceremonial law as the other, and equally concerning a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of worſhip. If our own Prelates whom Chriſt our Lord inſtituted to overſee his flock ſhould for reaſons beſt known to themſelves take from us thoſe little ſmall helps we have by the Images of ſome of our Anceſtors, Martyrs, Apoſtles, Virgins, Confeſſors, then would we be without them, and yet not think our ſelves to loſe one jot of our Religion for that. But we will not forfeit them for any Law made by Moſes, except it be eſtabliſhed and ratified by our own Law-maker or his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates watching over us under our Lord unto our good, if Moſes ſhould have made any law againſt them, which indeed he did not, but only againſt Heathen-Idols. And if any one ſhould endeavour to have or Chriſtian repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations to be aboliſhed, becauſe he thinks and believes that Moſes forbad them, then is that Man ſay I, bound to obſerve all the whole law of Moſes, as it is literally expreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is no imaginary Opinion of mine own, but what reaſon and the Spirit of God moved St. Paul to aver as ſtoutly in the caſe of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is another of Moſes Laws, as I do here. I teſtifie to every Man, ſaith he, who is circumciſed, that he is bound to keep the whole Law. And this muſt needs be true, moſt certainly true for by obſerving circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe it was commanded by Moſes he ſubjects himſelf to the Law and Authority of Moſes as his Prince and Legiſlator; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is bound to obſerve him equally in all things which he commands with the ſame authority and will to be obeyed, which is no leſs then all his whole law. And curſed is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, who is under the law, and continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to fulfil them. Although then it ſhould be granted that Moſes by his law prohibited all kind of figures and repreſentations, even thoſe uſed by Chriſtians, which he did not, yet if our Lord ratified it not, it does not touch us at all. And that he did not renew or ratifie it, is ſufficiently clear to Proteſtants, becauſe no ſuch law of his is found among the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: and unto Catholicks no leſs, becauſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57867:32"/>there is neither Goſpel nor Tradition for it. And if all men would ſeparate themſelves from prejudice, which blinds and hardens them in their conceits, they might eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that neither Chriſts immediate Diſciples nor any Chriſtians that ſucceeded them after our Lords departure, would have either fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or hated the figure of our Lords counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if by chance they would have met with it. But if any one notwithſtanding, fully perſwaded that Moſes made a law againſt all ſort of Images and repreſentations, ſhould upon that authority of his aboliſh ours, he is bound alſo upon the ſame authority to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice an Ox, and obſerve all the whole law in all and every particular, under the penalty of ſin.</p>
               <p>Since therefore by the order of God and <hi>Moſes</hi> many graven things were made; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations and ſimilitudes both in Heaven and Earth, notwithſtanding the ſaid law; as the Serpent of braſs (which muſt either be made by melting or graving) pomegranates, lilies, and various ſuch-like things both graven in ſtone and interwoven in ſilks. Cherubins or Angels in the Propitiatory, even in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, and afterwards more fully and plentifully in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple; it is not rationally to be doubted, but that this law of his was intended only to keep thoſe People cloſe and conſtant
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57867:32"/>to their own God and to their own Religion, which was inconſiſtent with the idols of the Nations; and not for any purpoſe of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, either out of their chamber hangings or ours. I know the Jews do urge this Precept of Moſes very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly againſt Chriſtians ever ſince Jeſus Chriſt our Lord was rejected by them, whoſe image and figure they cannot abide to ſee. But we muſt have patience with all men.</p>
               <p>§ 9. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith he, <hi>grounded this law of his upon a reaſon unchangable, namely that Gods infinite and incomprehenſible. Deity cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</hi> O profound invention! This is ſuch a law and ground of a law, as was never before thought of. The ground and reaſon of making a law muſt be this, an impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breaking it. They muſt not make any repreſentations of God, becauſe God cannot be repreſented. And the ſame motive or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will be equally proper for all the reſt of the Commandments: <hi>They muſt keep the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the week a holy day.</hi> The reaſon and motive; becauſe there is not an eighth day to keep holy and ſanctifie. <hi>They muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Parents.</hi> The ground and reaſon of this; becauſe none of the whole Camp had any Fathers or Mothers alive to diſhonour. <hi>They muſt not kill.</hi> The motive and reaſon is: becauſe they were all ſhot-free, and ſo firmly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57867:33"/>inchanted that none could hurt them. <hi>They muſt not commit adultery.</hi> The ground and reaſon is; becauſe there was never a Woman in the Camp, which any man though provok'd with the higheſt luſt could poſſibly come near or touch with a pair of tongues. <hi>They muſt not ſteal.</hi> The great cauſe thereof is, that there is nothing at all in the Camp for any man to take away. Thus the Doctor imagines Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to forbid any repreſentations of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot be repreſented. And ſuch another diſcreet Mounſieur was he who ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly commanded his Bowyer not to make him any ſhafts at all of a Piggs tail: and he gravely gave him the reaſon for it, becauſe quoth he of a piggs tail no ſhaft can be made. Truth is, Moſes never thought of any ſuch Law, nor any ſuch reaſon of it much leſs; but provided for the ſecurity of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews Religion, that it might remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable and firm in the mids of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations round about them who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſe Gods and idols: as Moſes very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interprets himſelf and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets after him. Therefore ſaith God by Moſes, thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me, thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as the Gentiles do, nor worſhip them. For I am a jealous God, and will have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingling of devilliſh idolatry with my
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57867:33"/>ſervice; And all the reaſon given by Moſes is gods jealouſie not induring any divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but his own. This is the very truth and all the truth of this buſineſs, which this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor would turn another way, thereby to make Moſes ſeem as ſimple a man as himſelf. And thoſe idols forbidden by Moſes did ſo involve an oppoſition to the true God and his divine worſhip, that People could not poſſibly betake themſelves to one, but they muſt leave the other. Therefore did Moſes forbid both other Gods beſides their own one God, and all idols together: which was by antient Chriſtians very rationally and wiſely reckoned all one and the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: whereof no leſs a Man, then St. Auſtin himſelf is witneſs. But the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob could bring no ſuch danger with them. And that is our care, for we are not in danger of looſing the faith of Jeſus Chriſt by keeping the Image of him our crucified Lord among us; or forſaking the communion of Saints by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their portraictures before our eyes. We ſhould <hi>ipſo facto</hi> renounce our Lord and all his whole Religion, ſhould we ſet up Moſes his forbidden Idols, and make it our religion to worſhip them as heathens did. But we are heartened, incouraged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in our Chriſtian Religion by looking
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57867:34"/>on the faces of ſo many our glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, holy Anchorets, and Hermits, pious Virgins and Confeſſors, who profeſt this our Religion before us, bravely triumphing by the power of Chriſts love and divine faith, over ſins allurements, and deaths uglieſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; though incompaſſed themſelves with the like paſſions and infirmities we are our ſelves invironed round about. And when we are entred into a Church amongſt ſo many of our worthy Predeceſſors, we compoſe our ſelves more heartily to our devotion then otherwiſe we ſhould do, in imitation of them; remembring now that we are come up to Mount Sion, to the City of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, to celeſtial Jeruſalem, and ſociety of Angels, to the Church of Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians conſcript in the Heavens, to God the Judge of all, to the Spirits of juſt men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, to Jeſus the Mediator of a new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the aſperſion of blood ſpeaking better things than Abel.</p>
               <p>§ 10. <hi>The Heathens,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>did ill in their idol worſhip, and yet the wiſer ſort among them teſtifie that they did not hold them to be Gods but worſhipped God in them.</hi> Our acute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine having now by his fine wit ſo clarified Moſes law, that it might not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Idolaters as our vulgar Painters; he now begins ſo to purifie idolaters practice
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57867:34"/>too, that they may ſeem but in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with our Catholick and beſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And who would not give his penny to hear him act and ſpeak. The heathens all in general are ſo excuſed in their idolatry. Aaron in his act of apoſtacy, and Jeroboam in his great ſin; that they are all and each of them no otherwiſe faulty then the Church of Rome in his books. Thus doth Mr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet convert idolatrous Nations, while he ſits dreaming in his Cloſet. Here he dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes and there he exaggerates, here he blacks with his Pen, and there he whitens; and then he cries out all is one, all of the ſame meaſure, all of the ſame colour. And truly I believe the great Gyant Goliah and little David might thus be made equal, if the Gyant were beheaded and cut off by the knees, on one ſide; and David on the other ſide, ſet upon a high pair of ſtilts.

                  </gap>icks are made to do what they do not, and Heathens not to do what they do, on a ſuppoſal that all this is true, there can be no great difference. Let us then hear him what he tells us of Heathens in general. <hi>The wiſer ſort among them teſtifie</hi> quoth he, <hi>that they worſhiped not the idols as gods, but worſhiped God in them.</hi> O very good? Thus the wiſer ſort among the Heathens ſay. But firſt who are theſe wiſer ſort? It behooved him to let
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57867:35"/>us know this. But yet for his own procket-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he does not. But 2ly what ſays he himſelf to it? O that is needleſs: for his Reader will underſtand well enough what he ought to think, when ſuch a Doctor as Stillingfleet tells him what the wiſer ſort have thought. No body would think with fools, but with the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort always. And his whole diſcourſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds on this ſuppoſed knowledge of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort, and according to it concludes. we cannot therefore doubt of his mind. But have we no wiſe ſort of antient believers who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among the Heathens, to teſtifie unto us what the heathens did? Have we no Apoſtles and Prophets to hearken to, no renowned and infallible perſons to inform us? Surely we have, and thoſe ſo many, that we need not have recourſe either unto perſons unknown amongſt the heathens for their teſtimony, or to Mr. Stillingfleet the ingenious trifler. He tells us, <hi>that the Heathens did not worſhip their Idols as Gods, but worſhiped God in them.</hi> But our Apoſtles and Prophets tell us contrary things. Hear <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak, who lived among the thickeſt of the Heathens; To whom did they ſacrifice, O <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom did the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens worſhip? <hi>Immolaverunt Demoniis &amp; non Deo, Deut.</hi> 32. They worſhiped not God but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, they ſacrificed to devils ſaith he, and not to God. The Nations change their gods, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57867:35"/>indeed they are no Gods, ſaith Jeremy ch 2. but my people have changed their glory unto an Idol. Baruch another Prophet brings in his teſtimony, chap. 4. You have provoked him who made you, ſaith he, even the eternal God, ſacrificing to Devils and not to God. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pſalmiſt he tells us no leſs peremptorily. That they immolated their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Devils, and ſacrificed to the idols of Canaan, Pſ. 105. and that all the gods of the Heathens are Devils, Pſ. 95. Saint Paul our own Chriſtian Doctor is bold, and expreſly, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies both againſt Stillingfleet and his wiſer heathens; That the things which Gentiles immolated, they ſacrificed to Devils and not to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. And yet after all this our Doctor is not aſhamed to juſtifie thoſe his clyents the heathens. <hi>They did not worſhip their Idols,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for Gods, but worſhiped God in them.</hi> And whom ſhall we here believe? Moſes, Jeremy, Baruch, david, St. Paul and all our Chriſtian Doctors, or Stillingfleet rather and his wiſer Heathens unknown to himſelf? They ſacrificed to Devils and not to God: they changed their glory into an Idol: they irritated the eternal God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molating to devils and not to God; they ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their ſons and daughters to devils not to God. Thus ſpeak our Prophets and Apoſtles. But Mr. Stillingfleet affirms, they ſacrificed to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57867:36"/>God, they imolated to God, they worſhiped God and not devils, they worſhiped not the Idols but God in them. But I diſcern well enough the cauſe of his miſtake. Becauſe they abſtracted the general notion of God, and applyed it, each one to his own idols; therefore he thinks he may ſay they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in them. But this is a groſs miſtake. For to worſhip God in a thing, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip a thing for God who is no God, are two very differing caſes Chriſtians worſhip God in Chriſt, and they do well; Heathens who worſhiped their Idols for God did ill. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well our late Uſurper after he had murdered our good King, and ſet the Crown upon his own head, would have taken it well, if his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had told him they honoured him for their King, but not, if they had ſaid they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King in him. The firſt word had ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his ears as a grateful flattery, the other as treaſon to himſelf. To abſtract the Deity and apply it to another ſubject unto whom it does not belong, is as far as we are able to behead the true God and ſet his Crown upon the ſhoulders of uſurping devils. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the true real Deity cannot be removed, either by the pleaſure of the Uſurper or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiper, therefore are theſe idols devils and falſe Gods. God cannot be worſhiped in them, becauſe he is not in them; and if they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57867:36"/>be worſhiped as Gods it is Idolatry; or elſe there is no ſuch thing as idolatry upon Earth.</p>

                  <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>made the golden Calf, not to reduce the People unto heathen idolatry, but for an embleme of the good Angel who was to go before them.</hi> Here is another excuſe of Aaron his ſmall fault; which drove Moſes his brother and Prince into as great a paſſion of wrath as perhaps he ever felt; even ſo prevalent a grief and anger, that it daſhed in pieces the very tables of the Law he had in his hands; though he was by the teſtimony of holy writ the mildeſt of men: and all this it ſeems for an embleme: And why that emblem? ſince they had ſuch an emblem be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the pillar of cloud by day and ſire by night; which was a more ſignificant emblem of the angel who went before them, then any Calf of gold could be. The holy Prophets teſtifie of thoſe People and Aaron, that in Moſes abſence this figure was melted and founded by them to be ſet up in place of the God, who had hitherto conducted them with Moſes now as they thought vaniſhed, out of Egypt into Arabia; and to lead them on the reſt of their way, as their ſupream conduct after the manner of Egyptian Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They made a calf in Horeb and adored the figure, they changed their glory into the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57867:37"/>likeneſs of a Calf eating hay and forgot their God, Pſal. 125. Now if they forgat their own God, and ſlighted him, and caſt him from them, and changed his glory into a Calf, and worſhiped the very figure: then muſt that ſculptil or ſtatue be now accepted for their God. The like teſtimony gives St. Stephen, Act. 7. They made ſaith he, a Calf in thoſe days, and offered ſacrifice unto the Idol, and made themſelves merry in the works of their own hands. What can this import, but that they had now altered their religion, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their former God, and made to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a new one after the manner of Egypt. It is pitty Mr. Stillingfleet had not been with Aaron; his confidence would have pleaded for him a little more handſomly then he did for himſelf. But the excuſe perhaps being hypocritical and falſe would have more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Moſes, than his former fault. Aaron knew well enough what he had done. And although he ſomewhat minced his fault, yet would he not tell a lye. I caſt a little mettal into the fire, ſaith he to Moſes, and there came out this Calf. The Doctor adds two pretty reaſons, why neither he nor the people, could ever think of declining then to any heathen idolatry, Firſt <hi>becauſe they had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of doing ſo.</hi> As though the very abſence of Moſes, whom they had long expected and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57867:37"/>now thought loſt, were not pretence enough, unto ſome leading men in the Camp to raiſe a ſedition and thereby force Aaron to make them ſuch idols, as they were acquainted with in Egypt. It is well enough known, that by the contagion of thoſe leading men, the Camp was ever and anon in ſuch like tumult and ready diſpoſition to apoſtacy. His ſecond reaſon is, <hi>becauſe no intimation is made that they fell into heathen idolatry.</hi> What intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is given thereof by the Prophet and St. Stephen he takes it ſeems for no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation at all. <hi>When they fell,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>into heathen idolatry, mention is made of their Gods, as Baal Peor, Moloch, Remphan; but here Aaron is ſaid to make a feaſt to the Lord:</hi> As though there were not Egyptian idols as well as Syrian; and Oſiris and Iſis, as well as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch and Remphan. And a feaſt made in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this their new God and Religion, might well be ſaid <hi>a feaſt to the Lord.</hi> It was a policy in Aaron, thus to ſpeak, that the common people might not ſuddainly diſcern the alteration. And we may eaſily believe that the leading men, who brought him by perſwaſion and force unto this apoſtacy, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted the ſaid ſtratagem; firſt to get the people more univerſally on their ſide without commotion: and then to put ſomething into their mouths for to ſay to Moſes, if he ſhould
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57867:38"/>chance to come upon them ſuddainly and take them beyond expectation in the fact. For that it was a meer pretence of policy is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this; that they gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> no ſuch account of any feaſt made unto their antient true God; and ſecondly becauſe their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Leaders had no purpoſe to make any, for they had now forgot and put away their own true God and caſt him out of their mind, as holy text ſpeaks, <hi>obliti ſunt Dei ſui.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Calves ſet up by Jeroboam in Dan and Bethel, were only to keep the People from going up to Jeruſalem, and not to bring them to any idolatry of the hearthens.</hi> Here is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for Jeroboam and his peccadillo. Who would not take Mr. Stillingfleet to be a very charitable man, who can cover ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſins? and yet is it all no other but a ſecret prodigious malice againſt Catholicks, who muſt bear the more and hear the worſe for it. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſaith he <hi>did not alter the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, or give any occaſion of idolatry;</hi> No, no. He only kept the People, ſaith he from going up to Jeruſalem, whither they uſed once a year to reſort. And this could be no ſuch great matter; ſince they had the ſame ſervice, the ſame ſacrifice and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at home. But why then is Jeroboam char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with idolatry in holy Scripture, as one that had done evil above all that went before
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57867:38"/>him, and made him other gods and molten images to provoke God to anger, and to caſt his own God behind his back, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 14. <hi>O, ho, thence we conclude</hi> ſaith our Doctor <hi>that an image ſet up for Gods honor is idolatry; as it is among Papiſts.</hi> And is not this a pretty nimble leigerdemaine of a ſlight man. Firſt who taught him that <hi>Papiſts ſet up images for Gods honour?</hi> I have learned amongſt them that they are ſet up for our incouragement and imitation, and for an honourable memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their holy Martyrs and Apoſtles. But what honour can one of thoſe images be to God? none at all I think, except indirectly, becauſe <hi>God</hi> is the bleſſed author of all good, whence the ſaid Apoſtles and Martyrs receiv'd their ſtrength and grace. Secondly where does this confident man find, that <hi>Jeroboam ſet up his images for Gods honour? Even no where at all.</hi> His own boldneſs is ſo ſtrong in him, that he ſays what he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt; without any ground or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at all any where, either among ſacred writers or prophane. Thirdly whence doth he gather his negative word, <hi>that Jeroboam acted none of the heathen idolatry, nor brought the People to it?</hi> Even from his own confident brain whence he has the other, expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the teſtimony of holy Writ which ſpeaks, as it were paſſionatly and very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically of his notorious idolatry, wherein he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57867:39"/>did evil above all that were before him, wherein he made him other gods and molten Images, to provoke God to anger, and caſt his own God behind his back. Can he be juſtly charged with all this, only becauſe he kept the Iſraelites from going up to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and made them do thoſe devotions at home which they were wont to do in that mother Citty. Can only change of place ſuffice for the criminous imputation of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where is the ſame adoration, ſame rites, ſame ſacrifice, ſame Prieſts, and ſame God. Is it poſſible that the ſame ſervice and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-book read by Miniſters of the ſame kind of London and Highgate, be Gods ſervice in one place, and idolatry in the other, all other things agreing but only the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place? No indeed, it is not poſſible it ſhould be ſo. But it is very poſſible it ſhould be ſaid ſo. Mr. Stillingfleet here ſpeaks it, and ſpeaks it ſtoutly, on his own head, even againſt all Divine authority and upright reaſon. People may ſin againſt eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical obedience indeed, by not coming up to their parochial Church when they are commanded. But they cannot, only upon that ground, be charged with idolatry, or making ſtrange gods, or caſting their own God b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57867:39"/>who lays that imputation upon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon no other ground or motive then that one circumſtantial neglect of place. And yet holy Scripture ſeveral times thus charges Jeroboam; and puts ſuch a blot upon his ſcutcheon both for his own idolatry, and that into which he induced all the people, that he is ſeldom or never mentioned without his black ſirname; <hi>Jeroboam who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> If it were true at leaſt, as Mr. Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet here ſpeaks, that Jeroboam and Iſraels ſin were only a circumſtance of place, and that they and he did in their own tribes but what was done in Jeruſalem, then muſt it needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there were in the Temple of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſuch like repreſentations, as thoſe Calves ſet up by Jeroboam in Dan and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and indeed the very ſame with them. And thence we may gather for our learning, if this be all true, an axiom of great truth and concernment; namely, that one and the ſame piece of worſhip which pleaſes God in the Catholick Church, is an abomination to him in the ways of hereſie and ſchiſme. The very ſame thing which in Jeruſalem and the tribe of Judah were called Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims; in Samaria and all the reſt of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el apoſtatiled from them, was but a Calf.</p>

               <p>§ 11. <hi>Charles the Great a noble Emperor cauſed Books to be ſet forth againſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Nice <hi>where images had been eſtabliſhed, called Carolin Books, and aſſembled alſo a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at</hi> Frankford, <hi>wherein both the ſaid Nicen Council was condemned, and all their reaſons for images confuted,</hi> &amp;c. That there were both in the Council of Frankford and Nice too, ſome Catholick Prelates who propounded difficulties againſt images cannot be denied. For when ever any Council meets together about any affair, they diſpute <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> both for and againſt it; that the Prelates having all things ſet before their Eyes that can be ſaid on both ſides, might be the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to determine.

All this is certain enough. But yet, that either in Frankford or any where elſe, were made after this their diſpute any final or concluſive declaration againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57867:40"/>that other of Nice unanimouſly concluded by the Prelates, and confirmed by the general Paſtour; this is a thing ſo apparently falſe and fictitious, that there needs no more but the knowledge of thoſe very Perſons and times to prove it ſo. Charles the Great was one that adored the Roman Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was himſelf a member, above all Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that ever was before or ſince his time. The Council of Frankford, wherein were little leſs then three hundred Catholick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, was peaceably concluded, and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion followed upon it; which muſt needs have riſen, if they had condemned another Council lately celebrated and confirmed by all paſtoral authority. Nor was that Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Council ever annulled or any way cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured either by P. Adrian or any after him. Add to this, that the ſaid Council was both begun and finiſhed under the ſame Pope A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian, and his Legates Theophilact and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus, who had preſided lately in the ſaid Nicen Council, where the lawful uſe of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was eſtabliſhed. It cannot poſſibly be imagined that the ſame Pope and Preſidents ſhould conclude in Frankford quite contrary to what they ordered in Nice but ſeven or eight years before. It is alſo certain, that the ſaid Council of Frankford, was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and aſſembled, not about images only as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57867:41"/>the Doctor imagines, but about the queſtion of our Lord Chriſt his filiation, as all antient hiſtories teſtifie, againſt Foelix and Elipand two Spaniſh Biſhops, and Claudius Taurinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, who teaching that our Lord is rather to be called an adoptive than natural Son of God raiſed much commotion in Spain and France: and this novelty of theirs was firſt condemned at Ratisbone, and afterwards at Frankford. For Foelix after his firſt condemnation, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Emperour Charles his Court who then wintered at Rheginum; and there ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Prelates, was ſent thence to the preſence of Pope Adrian, where in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral of St. Peter, he revok'd his Errour. Elipand hearing of his ſubmiſſion grew more violent, and by his books both regained Foelix again, and diſturbed all Germany, as he had France and Spain before. And now to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the infection, the Pope and Charles the Emperour agreed to bring together a conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Aſſembly of Prelates in Frankford, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in preſided Theophylact and Stephanus, who had lately concluded the ſecond Council of Nice. Whence it clearly appears that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Stillingfleet quite miſtakes the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Now if the ſame Pope and his very ſelf-ſame Legates preſided firſt in the Nicen Council, and then in Frankford, as the Doctor acknowledges, we may rationally
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57867:41"/>enough conclude, that the Nicen decrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout images, lately finiſhed in the Eaſt, were made known to the Weſt by their acceptation and promulgation at Frankford, where the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of filiation was decided: For this is indeed very true. But no way can we think that the ſame Preſidents would now undo, what they had done a little before. And that this is indeed the whole truth in this buſineſs, may be yet confirmed by the authority of the Council of Senon kept not long after, which in their 14. decree thus ſpeaks, <hi>Carolus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Francorum Rex Chriſtianiſſimus in Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum furdenſi conventu ejuſdem erroris iconoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorum ſuppreſſit inſaniam quam infeliciſſimus quidam Faelix in Gallias &amp; Germanias invexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> By this teſtimony it appears, that Felix over and above his capital errour about Chriſt our Lords adoption, was an iconoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus too or adverſary of images, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Frankford for both his errours: which is not unlikely by the teſtimony of Platina and Paulus Emilius: For Platina in the life of Pope Adrian, <hi>Bienni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that all theſe things rightly conſidered and put together, will ſufficiently convince his relation of the Frankford Council to be fictitious and groundleſs. If the Council were aſſembled by the agreement of the Pope and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, then not of the Emperour againſt the Pope. If to ſuppreſs Elipand, Claudius, and Felix; then not the Nicen Prelates. If un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Pope and Preſidents which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided lately in Nice, then not againſt any thing determined and concluded in Nice. If upon the motive of Elipands errour againſt our Lord's filiation; then was not an image the principal occaſion of it. If Felix were there condemned for his oppoſition to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then were not images condemned. If Charles the Great, one of the devoureſt to the Roman Church that ever raigned, ſo much ſwayed in that Council, then would he not ſuffer the Roman Church to be there affronted and cenſured. If an upright Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, he would not in ſpiritual affairs gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay the Prince of Prelates, who had ſo lately ſet his hand and ſeal to Nicen definitions. In a word, if Charles the Great called that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57867:42"/>Council at Frankford, as the Doctor affirms, then without all doubt was that ratified there, which was eſtabliſhed at Nice a little before. For Charles was as much a Roman Catholick as either Stephen and Theophilact, or the Pope himſelf, and knew as well as any man, what obedience is due to the definitions of a Council rightly conſummated and confirmed, as that of Nice was, Binius the great Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the Councils proves at large, that all this ſtory of the Carolin books and Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Synod aſſembled againſt that of Nice, is a groundleſs fiction. And ſo do Alanus, Surius, Vaſquez, and ſeveral other Doctors. And they are all amazed, whence the rumour ſhould ariſe, and by whom, and in what age or time. But I cannot wonder much at it, ſince I heard lately of a French Gentleman, who affirms and ſhows in a Book of his, that the Engliſh never conquered France, nor ever gave them any one overthrow in battle. And when he was told by a neighbour, of this his notorious falſhood; O, quoth he, my book two hundred years hence may paſs for an authority as good as any that ſpeak other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And ſo I think there may poſſibly be ſuch impious men, who out of their preſent malice may furniſh out a lie to inſect poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in after times. But he muſt be an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable wicked man who can do ſuch a deed.</p>

It is indeed unlikely that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of thoſe holy Perſons, who firſt ſpread our Chriſtianity in the World, and made it good both by their lives and death, ſhould be frequent in primitive times.
Firſt, becauſe thoſe ſame figures, although they be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able memories both of their perſons and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, unto whoſe zeal and goodneſs we are ſo much indebted; yet are they not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requiſite unto any ſuch purpoſe, but that the Church can be without them.Secondly, becauſe primitive Chriſtians had not amongſt them any ſuch plenty of Artiſts, as we have now a days to make them.Thirdly, becauſe Pagans would have miſ-interpreted the end and meaning of ſuch figures, as this our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor does in the midſt of day light. But that in thoſe primitive times there was never any Chriſtian ſo ill affected towards thoſe pious repreſentations as is Mr. Still. appears ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by the teſtimony of thoſe ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who mention incidentally the cuſtoms
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57867:43"/>of thoſe primitive times; eſpecially about the figure of the Croſs, which they made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on their fore-head and breaſts, as a preſervative againſt evil, and kept it all over their houſes, particularly in their Bed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and cloſets, either framed in wood or ſtone, or painted in colours. There be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the deluge of time which ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up all things, ſome monuments yet left among us of the reſpect which thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans then bore both to the reliques and figures of their Saints.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57867:44"/>Theophilact, Damaſcenus and ſeveral others. And here we may take notice by the way, that charity and devotion ſet up ſtatues to our Lord, but apoſtaſy &amp; malice pulls them down. And whether Doctor Stillingfleet, who buſies himſelf ſo much to caſt down the Images of Jeſus our Lord and his holy followers, would refuſe to have his own ſet up for his great pains, either in Guildhall or Cheapſide, he knows beſt himſelf. Truly if that were done, I do not believe that any of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or Countreymen would take him then for a Calf of Bethel. Of the Images of the Virgin Mary made by St. Luke, there is much fame amongſt the antient writers, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Theodorus, Simeon Metaphraſtes and Nicephorus: The laſt of which does alſo atteſt in his ſecond book, that the ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Relick was carried up and down the whole habitable World of Chriſtians, who looked upon it with a moſt greedy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied devotion. The ſame Nicephorus adds moreover, how Conſtantius the Son of Conſtantine tranſlated the Relicks of St. Luke from Thebes, of St. Andrew from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia, and of St. Timothy from Epheſus, unto Conſtantinople, with a vaſt concourſe and joy of Chriſtian People: and there with all honour and reverential reſpect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrined them in a Cathedral Church dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Of another Image of Jeſus Chriſt made by Nicodemus, which being ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly crucified by the Jews wrought many wonderous miracles, we have a ſolemn teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Athanaſius cited in the fourth action of the ſeventh great Synod. And all this teſtifies that Chriſtians in primitive times were affected towards holy Pictures and Relicks as Catholicks are at this day: at leaſt not ſuch haters and vilifiers of them as is Dr. Stillingfleet. Nor can I conceive how any of the learned in the Church of Rome ſhould be ignorant of theſe things. Nay, the very Church of England, which this Doctor pretends to defend, hath lately put the Images of the Apoſtles and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Saints into their Common-prayer-book and Primers printed by authority. So that if the Doctor had opened his eyes he might have ſeen clear enough, that all this talk of his is now unſeaſonable, however it might have paſſed well enough in the beginning of the furio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Punchienella, though Bartholmew fair be ended, may be acted ſtill either in Lincolns-Inn-fields or Chairing croſs or any where elſe, both now and then and ſeven Years hence. It will be ſtill new to ſome body. But Sir, you are to take notice, that nothing being ſo oppoſite to Jeſus our Lord, or his holy law; or even to common reaſon, then Idolatry; the Doctor has craftily placed it, in the very front of his forlorn hope, therby ſurely to affright ſilly Catholicks from their old ſtation, and to deter all others from Communion with them, as Perſons grievouſly guilty of abominable, Pagan, even worſe than Pagan Idolatry; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Sir <hi>Mandevils Gyant</hi> in the enchanted Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Python,</hi> cannot be more terrifying to a <hi>Night-Walker;</hi> nor Sir <hi>Hudibras</hi> his Squire, mounted on the out-ſide of his ſoft-footed ſteed, to the diffiding <hi>Fidler;</hi> then this Sir Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <hi>Monſtrous Idol,</hi> to one who claims part with Chriſt in God. True it is, ſome of the prime Reformers, and others who ſince have thrived in the World therby, through a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, againſt the zealous Prelates of the Catholick Church, who oppoſed their Ambition, or Luſt, or both, did caſt this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Aſſertion of Idolatry upon Us, for our

Did he ever read, a Divine Worſhip ultimately terminated upon figures, to be allowed by any Canon of the Roman Church? Did any of our Catholick Doctors or Schoolmen, whom he ſeems to have ſwallowed by ſhoals, ever aſſert that termination? Did he learn that Doctrin from any profeſſor of the Catholick faith? I am ſure he did not. But we muſt give the Doctor leave to walk in his own Maze, and to think, and ſpeak, and write too, what he pleaſes; Worſhip of its ſelf, is of a great latitude, therefore to ſpeak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he ſhould ſet down what he means by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57867:47"/>Divine Worſhip, as diſtinct from other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Worſhips, Religious and Civil, wherby it becomes proper to God; then, he ſhould appoint the formal End to which that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip tends, according to the nature of the act, and the duty of him that gives it; but thus concealing, what alone would have cleared Us from his grand calumny, he endeavours to puzzle and delude his greedy Readers, into a belief of our Idolatry, and to a great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Reverend and Worſhipful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorhood; knowing them to be weathercock-like, eaſily whirl'd about with every grave blaſt of his, if it blows but in the teeth of Popery. He again diſcovers his own real or wilful Ignorance, of what Relative Worſhip is, and whether it tends; every termination of a Latreutical affection or action, wherwith we honour God, as the Authour of life and death, ſignified by the ſacrifices of the Old Law, makes not that Worſhip relative, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Worſhip of God immediatly in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, would be Relative too Relative Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip imports a reference of one object to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in our Worſhip, which therfore looks not upon the former, either as the motive, nor yet as the ultimate term of its tendency, but only as it does occaſionally awaken our ſpirits confined to ſenſible obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the good Saint Paul, will have us bow at the Holy Name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and why not at the Name of GOD or JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH; and that, whether it be imagined, ſpoken, printed or painted? ſith God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ineffable by any of them; and what One repreſents to the Mind, the other to the Ear, the latter does to the Eye. Their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks too requires a Worſhip of their figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Bread, and their graver Clergy will ſtil bow to, and be uncovered before, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Board; and who not, when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon prays? I have ſeen Images of the Saints, even of Chriſt at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bound up in their Common-prayer-Books, and Uſed by Proteſtants, without fear of Idolatry; and K.

All this Dr. <hi>Still,</hi> might have conſidered, But his tongue is hot, and he muſt ſpeak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be againſt himſelf, and the very Church he juſtifies, as much as it is againſt the Church he arraigns.

               <p>Mr. H.

Thus ſpeaks that learned Man, the Phaenix of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who only dares to be honeſt. And the meer authority of this eminent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant may ſuffice to evacuate all the ſophiſtry of this whole Chapter of this Doctors book: as alſo of that which follows in the next place about our holy Hoſt and Saints.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, I muſt bid you farewel. And that you may not think me either idle or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective of my duty and reſpects to you, pray give me leave to tell you, that what you ſee here printed but now, was written and ready
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57867:49"/>for the Preſs in Auguſt laſt. And before October ended I had finiſhed all my work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dr. Stilling fleet's Book, ſuch-like familiar Commentaries, as theſe upon his firſt chapter be. But in all theſe Six Moneths I could get no more Printed for You either at home or abroad, than this poor Fifth Part of the whole, after my many travels, vexations, expences and dangers. Such obſtructions are made about the Preſſes, and ſo many vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences offered here continually, far above any uſed ſince we were born, that I can ſee no poſſibility for any whole Book of ours to ſhoot that gulf, be our cauſe never ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and good. Nay, they will here Print our Catholick Books themſelves, as if they were their own, as Thomas a Kempis, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, Parſons Reſolutions, Drexelſius, and the like. But if we be taken Printing them, the PRESS is broken, PRINTER puniſhed, and we, if we be found, in danger of our Lives. And therefore I beſeech you, Sir, be content with thus much, or rather this little. The reſt you ſhall have in written hand. In the mean time let Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> triumph and crow as he pleaſes.

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am glad you have received my firſt Packet, lately and indeed too late tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to you: and yet more, that you reſt contented with my brief Poſtill upon ſo ſmall a parcel of Dr. Stilling fleets Book, after ſo long an expectation. Sooner than I did I could ſend you nothing: and although I could have ſaid more upon the firſt Chapter which I ſent you, yet ſince you are ſatisfied with it, I am now content that I ſaid no more. Sir, by that his beginning you may well ſuſpect, that the Doctor means to deal inſincerely with us. And this you ſhall ſee ſo plainly in each parcel of his Book, that you will grieve at his wilfull and ſtudied inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For as to the aboveſaid buſineſs of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, firſt he knows well enough, that to ſet up the Statues and Images of renowned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons after their deceaſe, of magnificent Kings, juſt Judges, learned Philoſophers, valiant Captains, illuſtrious Hiſtorians, powerfull Orators, flouriſhing Poets, great Inventers of Arts and Sciences for a Nations good, has been, and is ſtill, and ever will be the cuſtom of all Nations upon earth; not wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57867:51"/>the very Jews themſelves, who keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo honourable memories of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob by Tradition of words, long before they travelled from Egypt into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine, where they were by the way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to make to themſelves, or worſhip any Idols of the Nations amongſt whom they might converſe, cannot be thought to have had any averſion from the figures or faces of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e their Anceſtors, if any they had, or could have had amongſt them. Secondly, the Doctor knows or ought to know, that three very great and good effects are apt to be wrought in poſterity, by means of ſuch fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of their worthy predeceſſors. For thoſe Images do both prolong their memories upon earth, which is ſome honour to them; and create a thankfulneſs in poſterity for their virtue and worthy deeds; and alſo inkindle in them an earneſt emulation of doing the like noble actions in ſucceeding ages. And thirdly, as little can he deny, that all theſe three both innocent and commendable effects are as apt to follow upon the ſight of our Lord and his holy Saints, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Virgins, whoſe Images only are regarded by the Church. Catholicks not only believe, but experimentally perceive, that ſuch repreſentations do quicken in them from age to age the beloved memory of our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57867:51"/>crucified Lord and all his bleſſed followers; that they incite in their hearts a thankfulneſs for ſo many their good deeds ſtill redounding to our good; and that they kindle a deſire of imitating them ſo often as they behold thoſe virtuous faces, once Pilgrims as we now are, and Believers with us; even as they imitated our Lord, by a ſtrange force and courage trampling Sin and Satan under their feet. And thus by Images we do reverence and honour Chriſt our Lord, and his holy Saints, with a reſpect and veneration due unto them, each one in his place and dignity. Nay one yet further good uſe do we, guided by our Faith and Religion, ſtill make of thoſe pious repreſentations: For being aſſured that our Saints in heaven do offer up their incenſe of prayers in behalf of their Brethren on earth, we ſeldom caſt our eyes upon their figures, but deſire in heart at leaſt, to reap ſome benefit thereby, partakers of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly interceſſion: Thus we do. But does Dr. Stilling fleet ſpeak of theſe things, or unto theſe things, or againſt any of theſe things? no not one word. Nor would any cuſtom of ours, or belief or doctrine of the Church, have brought in any of the contents which make up his firſt Chapter, wherein our Image-idolatry is declared and confuted by him.

This was the fault of Aaron, the fault of Jeroboam, the fault of all the Heathens who worſhipped God in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Idols.</hi> Thus our Doctor ſpeaks: and this is all he ſpeaks, quite beſides his buſineſs and our Catholick cuſtom. For our Images are the repreſentations of our Lord Chriſt born and crucified for us; and of his holy Apoſtles and Martyrs, and other his renowned followers. And although we believe Chriſt our Lord to be God, yet the Image of Chriſt and the Image of God are two different things, as all men know. This then is the reaſon, why he words his charge againſt us in that manner he does, with much inſincerity. For if he had only charged us with that which we only do; namely, that we make Images of Chriſt and his bleſſed Saints; or that we worſhip and honour them thereby; this would not have brought in thoſe many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57867:53"/>of his long diſcourſe, nor would he have had any thing thereof to have ſaid againſt us. And ſurely we can only honour them by Images, whoſe Images we ſet up for our uſe; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And it is in vain for him to reply, that we uſe alſo the repreſentations of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: For we have none of theſe as they are in themſelves, but as they have appeared unto us; the Holy Ghoſt in the form of a Dove, the Son in the form of man, and Father as he founds to us under that notion in our ear: which are ſtill no repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the inviſible Deity, of which the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57867:53"/>Doctor ſpeaks. And he may remember too, that the preſent Church of England, which he pretends to defend, allows and uſes all theſe Images alſo; even that of God the Father, which many of our Catholick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have excepted againſt and endeavoured to ſuppreſs, however ſome others amongſt them have thought withall, that ſuch a figure might well enough be permitted: becauſe what may be repreſented to the ear, may in the ſame manner be repreſented to the eye alſo. Thus much Sir of the Doctors inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hitherto. And what pretty Sophiſtical tricks he uſes afterward, you may ſee in due time and place. You may note only for the preſent, that after his imagined overthrow of our Chriſtian Images, he now in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter invades our antient Sacrifice typified by Melchiſedek his bread and wine, which he calls the Hoſt: juſt according to the firſt method of the furious Reformation, which firſt battered our Church-windows, and then ſlurred down the Altar-table.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The adoration of the Hoſt is a grand piece of Idolatry in the Roman Church: Nor will it ſuffice them here to plead, that they believe Chriſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57867:54"/>to be in the Euchariſt on the ſame divine motives they believe Christ to be God, and that they may therefore worſhip him there: for if there were a revelation of his preſence there, yet is there not the ſame command of worſhipping him there, as is of his perſon. Let all the Angels of God adore, and again, all muſt honour the Son as they do the Father, but no news of worſhipping the Hoſt. But ſecondly, there are not the ſame grounds to believe Chriſts preſence here, as that Chriſt is God; and if that preſence be not, then is it idolatry without excuſe. It is here granted, that the perſon of Christ viſibly appearing to us in any place, may be worſhipped: but there is not the ſame reaſon of believing and ſeeing. And if any reply, bleſſed is he who hath not ſeen and believed, he may know, that that word is here impertinent, relating not to this matter, but to the Reſurrection. It is alſo granted, that in the celebration of the Euchariſt, we are to give a ſpiritual worſhip to Chriſt, as well as to the Father; performing that Religious Act with a due veneration of his majeſty and power; with a thankfulneſs for his goodneſs, a truſt in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and a ſubjection to his ſupreme authority. We grant alſo, that external reverence may be ſhewn in the time of receiving the Euchariſt, in ſignification of our humble and thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his benefits. But we deny, firſt, that Divine worſhip is to be given to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57867:54"/>Elements on the account of a real preſence, or that the ſame adoration is to be given out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as in it: And this is the only Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. For how can one be ſure, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is ſuch in it ſelf as deſerves worſhip, ſine it ſeems Bread ſtill? The Scripture that ſayes This is my Body, may be otherwayes interpreted; and then the words will not make it out: and the ſence of them given by Fathers is hard to ſeek, and harder to find, the world being full of diſputes about it. The ſence of the preſent Church can ſtand in no ſtead; For is it enough that the Pope ſay ſo? No. If he define it? No. If a General Council concurre with him? No; unleſs they proceed in a right way: and who knows that? Beſides, how can we tell that he who conſecrates is a Prieſt, or hath any intention to do it? And as we cannot be ſure of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of worſhip there; ſo neither that we have yet ſufficient reaſon to worſhip. For Divines are not reſolved, whether the humanity of Christ, taken abſtractively from the Divinity, be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Divine worſhip: ſo that if the humanity be preſent with the Divinity, it is uncertain whether I may worſhip it; and as distinct from the Divinity, it is certain I cannot: And though out of the Sacrament we may worſhip Chriſt ſafely enough, yet not ſo in the Sacrament, where his corporal preſence is the cauſe of our adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perhaps without the Divinity at all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57867:55"/>which is unto no purpoſe of Chriſts inſtitution. But ſuppoſe Chriſts Divinity be preſent, yet this gives not ground enough of worſhipping the thing wherein he is preſent: For how and why ſhould it be? Here are their Doctors puzled mightily, to ſhew how their worſhip is terminated in this caſe, and how God is united to the Sacrament more then to the Sun and Moon; and whether there be any hypostatical union in one place more then another: What can they urge for any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority of this their worſhip? The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Roman Church? That is nothing worth. Catholick Tradition? Let them ſhew it. Scripture? That cannot do it alone, without Council and Fathers, as ſome of their own learned men acknowledge. For the words, This is my Body, may ſtand with a Metaphorical, as well as a real ſence. But if they chance to be miſtaken in the belief of this Doctrine, then can they not certainly be excuſed from Idolatry, as their own men, Biſhop Fiſher, and others do acknowledge; no more then the Manichees and ſome others, who ſaid Chriſt was the Sun, and therefore worſhipped it. Veneration and Invocation of Saints is another piece of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. 1. The Author having proſecuted in one long Chapter the firſt piece of our Catholick Idolatry, he beſtows upon us another here as long as it, about two other our Idolatrous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57867:55"/>the Euchariſtian Hoſt, and Saints. For Idolatry is ſuch a rumbling ſound, that he thinks not fit to confine it to one Chapter, as the other three ſubjects, <hi>Indevotion, Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme</hi> and <hi>Diviſion;</hi> but we muſt hear of it on both ſides our head, unto our double confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But it is here to be noted, that he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges now the mode of his Sophiſtry in to a new kind, I ſuppoſe for his Readers refreſhment; Before he caſt beams, now he throws motes into our Eyes. Our Images he confounds by the Loggs of Heathen Idols; but our Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt by the duſt of Philoſophical curioſities; which he ſo ſpreads abroad that he loſeth his own eye-ſight.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And as he changes his Logick, ſo does he alter his phraſe alſo. And he has a reaſon for that too. In his firſt Chapter he charged us with worſhiping God <hi>by Images,</hi> and <hi>in Images:</hi> now he does not ſay in the like phraſe, that we worſhip God <hi>in the Hoſt,</hi> or <hi>by the Hoſt.</hi> And of this his ſudden change of phraſe, I believe every Reader does not take notice, or perceive a reaſon, though the Author have one, and that a good one for it, and I think a couple. For firſt a waggiſh wit muſt ſo provide, that he impoſe upon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, not that which is true, or ſounds true, but what is, or ſounds falſe. To worſhip God <hi>in Images</hi> ſounds falſe: but to worſhip God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57867:56"/>
                  <hi>in the Hoſt</hi> ſounds true: and therefore he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that upon Catholicks, but not this. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, This his diverſity of phraſe brings him in all the materials of that his firſt and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chapter, which he could never by any force have haled into his paper, unleſs he had carefully ſo placed his words, as here he does. The charge of worſhipping God <hi>in Images,</hi> gave him occaſion to talk <hi>how ſuch a worſhip cannot terminate upon God; how that the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deity cannot be repreſented; how the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens worſhipped God in their Idols; how that Aaron and Jeroboams ſin was no other, &amp;c.</hi> which materials till up his firſt Chapter; and had all failed him, had he ſpoke ſingly of the reſpect which Catholicks bear to their holy Apoſtles and Martyrs, repreſented either to their ear or eye: which is all they do. On the other ſide, his charge of worſhipping <hi>the Hoſt,</hi> and not God <hi>in the Hoſt,</hi> opens him a paſſage for all the talk of this his ſecond Chapter: how <hi>that we have no command in Scripture of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Hoſt, though we be commanded to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt: how that we have no ground to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Elements; how that we cannot be ſure that the Host is an object of worſhip: how School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are puzled to declare the union with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Symbols; &amp;c.</hi> which are his mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials againſt this ſecond parcel of our Idolatry: and had all failed him too; had he fairly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57867:56"/>upon Catholicks a worſhip of God <hi>in the Hoſt,</hi> as before he did a worſhip of God <hi>in Images.</hi> For theſe two great reaſons he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily impoſes upon them in choice phraſes of his own; that people may hear and read in both places, not what Catholicks do, but what they do not: and yet ſo confidently charged upon them, as if it were their right. And thus he makes ſport for himſelf but marrs none; very careful, not to obſtruct, but ſet open a way for his prattle; which is a pretty piece of wit, if it had a little honeſty to make it relliſh.</p>
               <p>§. 3. I do not perceive the Author to be ſo jolly in this his ſecond Chapter, as in his firſt. Nor does he argue ſo poſitively againſt this great work of Chriſtian Religion, no leſs ſolid and certain then Chriſtianity it ſelf; as he did before againſt the ceremonious uſe of an Image; which Catholicks heed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways then ornaments of their Religion, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſo many ſweet fragrant Roſes and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of their Martyrs and other bleſſed Saints. And therefore Dr. St. winks himſelf, that his reader may think here is no truth to be ſeen. Full of doubts he is, that Catholicks may be thought doubtful. <hi>What can they ſhow, what can they urge for this their worſhip? The authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Roman Church? that is little worth.</hi> A ſpeedy, quick and dextrous diſpatch. <hi>Catholick
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57867:57"/>tradition? where is it? why do they not ſhew it? who ever heard of it?</hi> Poor man, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee wood for trees, nor London perhaps in the midſt of Cheapſide, except ſome body point at it. The numerous volumns that have ſet forth this Catholick tradition, as eminent, as clear, as univerſal as Chriſtianity it ſelf, he now remembers them not; no not any one of them can he now call to mind, to lead him out of the maze he is in. <hi>Will they pretend Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? all that is diſputed, that is otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>térpreted.</hi> If he continue in this his perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he will turn Atheiſt by and by. For there is no one Article of Chriſtian faith, or Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſpeaks it, but has been diſputed, denied and otherwiſe interpreted. <hi>What can Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do without Councils? and what are Councils but fallible miſtaking bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes?</hi> A ſad plight the man is in: but it is on his own accord and free will; that his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may imagine Catholicks who are all the world over in a peaceable poſſeſſion of this their faith, to be in the ſame pickle too. He ſimply conceits Catholicks to have their faith to pick up ſome where; and he cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tell where they ſhould glean it, with any aſſurance or quiet: at leaſt he would have it thought they cannot. <hi>Bellarmin, ſaith he, declares by convincing arguments, that Chriſt is God and to be worſhipped: but what Church,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57867:57"/>what tradition, what Counſel, what Fathers tell us any ſuch thing of the Hoſt?</hi> Alas poor dark man! we muſt not then ever think to pick our Religion out of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> it ſeems. And ſo muſt needs be in the ſame caſe with thoſe Chriſtians who lived before <hi>Bellarmins</hi> time; that is to ſay, either to have our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion already without <hi>Bellarmins</hi> help, or to ſeek it. But where had <hi>Bellarmin</hi> yet a Child, where had he his Faith before he wrote any thing? ſurely not out of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> books. It is a wonder the Dr. thinks not of this, to help him a little to his ſound ſences. But he is in his extaſie, and will be in it ſtill; And he tells us in this his rapture, that <hi>Bellarmin proved by convincing arguments, that Chriſt is God, and to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped; but who ever ſaid the like of the Hoſt?</hi> We know, and remember well enough that the ſame <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who proves ſo labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that Chriſt is God, declares alſo no leſs effectually in a whole treatiſe of the ſame vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of controverſies, both our Lords Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence in the Euchariſt, and our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream veneration, love and honour there due unto him. This we know; and this the Dr. did himſelf know alſo, before he drave himſelf into theſe his fained Apoplexies; wherein he has indeed ſome imperfect glimpſes of it, even now, that we may give
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57867:58"/>him his due; but the whole treatiſe in <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> ſeems to him now at this his diſtance, but as a ſmall black mote, ſuch as an Eagle may happly appear to us flying in the Clouds five miles high above our heads; an atome, a little on this ſide nothing; and therefore not worth ſpeaking of. And by this means he goes on glibly in his extacies, and excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations unto the end. <hi>What ground have Papiſts, what ground have they for this their worſhip? Scripture? Tradition? Councels? Fathers? Church? Reaſon? where are they? what are they worth? who ever ſaw them? why are they not ſhown?</hi> Thus the good man raves. Although all people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this laſt and worſt age, who ever in any place bore the name of Chriſtians, both La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and Greek Biſhopricks, who filled up Europe; and all the reſt every where; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians, Habaſſins, Maronites, Jacobites, Muſcovites, Melthites,</hi> had all of them this one ſolemn adoration of God in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as the great work of Chriſtianity; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though antient Fathers, eſpecially the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have left more record of it, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parcel of Chriſtian belief and practice; although many great, laborious, and learned volumnes have been ſet forth in this laſt age, both in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> whereby that Catholick piety is ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57867:58"/>that none who conſiders things in earneſt, can refrain to acknowledg it; yet does Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in his deep extaſy forget all this, and cryes out, <hi>who ever ſaid it? who ever proved it? who ever profeſt it?</hi> And he hopes his Reader, who is ſeldom wiſer than his book, will anſwer to his queſtion, and ſay, No body, No body Sir, you are in the right; and Papiſts are meer Fools and Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</p>
               <p>§ 4. The drift of this Chapter is to ſhew that we can neither believe our Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Euchariſt, nor do any homage to God in him, there figured according to his own ſolemn Inſtitution, as Crucified among us unto our reconciliation and peace. And truly his diſcourſe here tending thereunto, is all of it ſo extraordinary ſlight, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell whether himſelf be ſerious, or that he do indeed take us all for Muſhromes, ſo ſoft and fooliſh, that we will be carryed away at his pleaſure by any thing, or indeed by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we have the ſame Divine Revelation of Chriſts preſence in the Euchariſt as of the Divinity of his Perſon; yet can we not poſſibly worſhip here as there; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there it is ſaid, let all the Angels adore him, but we have no command to worſhip the Hoſt.</hi> As though one and the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Let all the Angels adore him,</hi> would
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57867:59"/>not ſerve indifferently both in Heaven and Earth, both for Angels and men, where ever he is preſent. The Divine revelation of his preſence needs no further command to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our worſhip; nor is that ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Let all men honour the Son, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and let all the Angels worſhip him,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to any one place, or to any one mode of his preſence. St. <hi>Paul</hi> worſhipped our Lord in the fields of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> where he met him after his Reſurrection. And yet he had never any command to worſhip him in thoſe plains, either of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> or <hi>Libanus.</hi> The particular Revelation of his preſence there, was a Monitor ſufficient of his duty. <hi>The perſon of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>viſibly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us in any place, may be worſhipped; but there is not the ſame reaſon of believing and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> All other good Chriſtians before Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> judged revelation and believing to be a ſurer teſtimony in matters of Faith and Religion, than our ſeeing is. Let us hear one of our Chriſtian Doctors ſpeak, whoſe teſtimony will ſerve for all the reſt. <hi>We have not declared unto you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, the vertue and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in any fabulous mythology; but as we have ſeen with our eyes his own Majeſty. For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God the Father, honour and glory, by a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yce conveighed unto him from that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57867:59"/>magnificence, ſaying thus, This is my well beloved Son, in whom is my ſole content. And this voyce we our ſelves heard derived from Heaven, when we were together with him in the holy Mount. And yet have we more firm Prophetical words, unto which while you attend as to a light ſhining in an obſcure place, ye ſhall do well, until the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y dawn, and the morning Star ariſe in your hearts.</hi> Thus ſpeaks St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> our Lords great Apoſtle, who, though he beheld our Lords Glory in the Mount, and heard there a voyce from Heaven unto his honour, yet he prefers before both theſe private teſtimonies, the one general Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Divine Revelation, as firmer and more authentical than either, or yet both of them put together, as the ſole ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinguiſhable general light, ſet up in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of this our dark life, for the aſſured guidance of all men. As if he had plainly told us, that our private ſences may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, eſpecially in matters of Apparitions and tranſitory Viſions, imparted unto ſome one or other apart. But prophetick ſpeech and revelation, this is general and the ſame to all; this is unerring and firm; this ſtands for ever. Here have we plainly good St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> mind in this affair. But our Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves otherwiſe. Divine revelation, although we have it, will not ſerve his turn. But if he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57867:60"/>could ſee Chriſt appearing to him any where, he could worſhip him then, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps do it. There is not the ſame reaſon with him, in believing and ſeeing, and that is indeed true, St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes ſo like wiſe. But St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, that believing is firmer than ſeeing: Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> avers, that ſeeing is firmer than believing. He would be afraid to act that upon meer Divine Revelation, which he will not fear to do upon ſight. Could he ſee Chriſt appear to him, he would worſhip him; but he cannot by any means worſhip him, where Goſpel teſtifies his preſence, and he ſees it not. Nay, he avers a little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that he can kneel down and worſhip Chriſt any where, excepting only in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, where his corporeal preſence is the cauſe of adoration. He can do it where no cauſe obliges him to it, no peculiar cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting it. But in no wiſe will he be brought to it, where his preſence known by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtands to claim it. Goſpel &amp; the cuſtome of Chriſtianity quite ſpoiles his Devotion, and keeps him from doing that homage to our Lord in the Church, which he could free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give him in a Market-place. <hi>And if any ſhould reply, quoth he, that bleſſed is he who hath not ſeen, and yet believed; he may know that this ſaying of his is impertinent to this preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe it relates only unto the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57867:60"/>This he ſpeaks, not conſidering that the ſaid aſſertion of our Lord, <hi>Bleſſed is he who ſees not, and yet believes,</hi> is indefinite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently general, equally appliable unto all things our Lord ever acted or taught us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe or hope for. And as our Lord uſed it to his Diſciples in the buſineſs of the Reſurrection, ſo muſt it hold good equally in that of his Incarnation, Aſcention, or any thing elſe he either ſpoke or acted for us. And though it be applyed unto one thing, it doth not therefore follow that it relates to nothing elſe, nor is pertinent to any other myſtery but that. We may well and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, according to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Bleſſed is he who hath not ſeen, and yet believed the Reſurrection. But we muſt not ſay, Bleſſed is he that hath not ſeen, and yet believed the Incarnation, Aſcention, Chriſts miracles in curing the Deaf, Dumb, Lame, and Blind; in raiſing the dead, and preaching eternal happineſs to his followers. Unto all this, that ſaying is impertinent with him, it relates to nothing at all but the Reſurrection. And have we not here a ſolemn and peculiar wit, and one that may well challenge the whole world to come forth into the open field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? But we muſt note here, that the Doctor does not grant any ſuch Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which may either clearly ſpeak our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57867:61"/>Lords preſence in the Euchariſt, or juſtifie our worſhip in it, only he permits it to paſs for diſputation ſake; and avers, that if there were any ſuch Revelation, yet would it not ſuffice to free us from Idolatry: and this he does to give us an experiment of his wit. And that experiment we have had, and muſt be content with it till more come.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>It is here granted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that in the celebration of the Eucha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We grant alſo, that external reverence may be ſhown in the time of receiving the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, in ſignification of our humble and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgment for his benefits.</hi> Here be a great many good things granted us here, and I take them thankfully. In his firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was ſo Zealouſly hot, that he would grant us nothing, no not ſo much as to hang up ſuch pictures in our Chambers as he has himſelf looking upon him in his own; but can we get this grant of his ratified and ſealed by all the Proteſtants in <hi>England?</hi> If it were, the Church of <hi>England</hi> would look the better for it. Nay, will not be himſelf, what he has granted us to day, revoke again to morrow?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57867:61"/>The Doctor ſhould do well to read over now and then his own grants and denyals. For he is not ſo fixed in them, that one dare take his word, as I could eaſily ſpecifie both in this and other particulars; But I refrain from that work now, as needleſs Sir to you; at leaſt we have as much here granted, as ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration requires. But I cannot perceive he will have any of it relate to ought ſubſiſting in the Euchariſt; but only to the Author of it, who is in Heaven, upon a conſideration of his benefits, which is ſome part of Catholick truth, though not intire.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>But we deny,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Divine worſhip is to be given to the Elements, upon the account of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>We deny that the ſame adoration is to be given out of Communion as in it; and this is the only Controverſy.</hi> I had thought he ſaid before, <hi>that he could worſhip Chriſt any where but only in the Euchariſt, where the corporeal preſence determins a worſhip.</hi> Now he ſeems to ſay, <hi>that he can worſhip him in Communion, and not out of it, and this the only controverſie.</hi> But we muſt take his grants and danyals ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not ſtand to tye them one to another, leſt we anger our Benefactor. What he gives, we muſt take thankfully, and not look

               <p>§ 7. <hi>They cannot be ſure,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the object deſerves worſhip, appearing ſtill bread; Scripture, that ſaies,</hi> This is my Body, <hi>may be otherwiſe interpreted, the ſence of the Fathers is hard to find; the preſent Church ſtands in no ſtead.

Even Chriſt our Lord appeared a meer man, but the eye of Faith apprehended him the Son of the Living God; a Child newly baptized appears, but the ſame it was, and yet is believed to be now regenerate and born again; all that is in man, appears mortal, but is not believed ſo. <hi>Mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57867:62"/>to remain in his Church for ever) <hi>This is my Body:</hi> and all Chriſtians hitherto have lived and dyed in this Faith. <hi>Scripture, that ſays, This is my Body, may be otherwiſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted.</hi> Conſidering they were the laſt words of our Loving Lord departing from us, and his final Legacy bequeathed his believers, they cannot be rightly interpreted, but as they ſound. And any other interpretation, that has been yet given by any againſt our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, amounts only unto thus much, <hi>This is not my Body,</hi> which is a ſtrange mad interpretation. <hi>The ſence of the Fathers is hard to ſeek,</hi> ſaith he. But who ſeeks after it? writers of controverſies may take pains to cull it out, and demonſtrate it to unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for their Converſion. But Catholicks have their Faith already, wherein they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated and bred up from their youth, united to their immediate Paſtors, as theſe are to the reſt of the Catholick Body. <hi>The preſent Church ſtands in no ſtead,</hi> why ſo? that is all in all, as the body is to the finger, hands, and other members, in which they all move: <hi>Is it enough, the Pope ſays it? No,</hi> &amp;c. This man here imagins, firſt, that Catholicks have their Faith to ſeek, which is his feeble imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Secondly, That Scripture cannot help them for his reaſon above ſpecified, as feeble as it: And Thirdly, That the preſent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57867:63"/>Church can availe as little, becauſe the Popes word is not aſſured, as though the Popes word were the preſent Church. And is not all this a ſtrange raving talk? All men know, I think Sir all men, excepting only this ſpiritual H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctor, that as Catholicks have their Faith and Religion by Tradition, from one Generation to another; ſo in it they have ever lived unanimouſly under their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Prieſts and Paſtors united altogether in the great Catholick Body, the preſent Church, and never look further. Nor is there any need at all, either of the Popes word or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, unleſs ſome great ſedition or ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Apoſtacy ariſe in ſome one or other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dioceſs. For then the Biſhop of the place calls for help of his fellow Biſhops, and the ſupreme Paſtor in particular, and concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Aſſemblies, as Governours extraordinary in a tempeſt which may indanger the ſhip. And Catholicks thus keeping cloſe together in one body, united with their Paſtors whom the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet over them for their ſafety and peace, cannot but remain ſteady and immoveable, by the aſſiſtance and bleſſing of that Lord who hath promiſed ever to be with them, even to the worlds conſummation. Nor do they ever ſeek for their Faith any where; for they have it ſufficiently already; and all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57867:63"/>it as they ought, that they may get Gods good Spirit, and his holy operations in themſelves, which is the end of their Religion, and all they do in it. And what a pretty peice of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is it in Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> to perſwade us that they cannot be certain of their Faith, who are certain, and know themſelves cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and declare ſo much before the face of the Sun, and all the eyes of Heaven, by their ſtability, fixedneſs, and immovability in Faith, even this particular Faith of our Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Euchariſt, ſo many ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuch vaſt diſtant places, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dictamen of their own ſences, but even againſt all the violence and ſubtilty of mankind, conſpiring to ſhake all the very nerves and bones of their holy Faith out of joynt. Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> has more need to conſider in Gods fear, how Catholicks do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to this ſtrange aſſurance, rather than emptily to tell us they cannot be ſure.</p>
               <p>§ 8. <hi>Their own School-men puzle, and are unreſolved how the whole Humanity can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, how united, how terminate a worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. Here is another handful of his duſt, his curioſity-duſt, to leſſen our aſſurance. If our School-men puzle, and are puzled, we muſt needs be thought unreſolved. But what do theſe School-men puzle, what are they unreſolved in? Not in their Faith, which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57867:64"/>ſays that our Lord is preſent with us in his holy Euchariſt; but in the Philoſophical <hi>Quomodo,</hi> or how this thing, or that thing is. And as they cannot diſagree in Faith, which they received all alike one and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame; ſo can they not agree in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which they invent and contrive very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, every one to himſelf, according to his genious and capacity. And what is all this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us believers, or to one and another among themſelves as they are all Chriſtians? even juſt nothing. I ſay juſt nothing can the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Faith be prejudiced, by any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening curioſities of men diſputing after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their maturer age about the <hi>Quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> of it, or the poſſibility of the contrary to it, or the ways of Gods working in it or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions deduced from it, or a hundred ſuch like things introduced by learned and ſubtile School-men, for the ſharpning of wits, and advancement of learning. The Doctor dreams I think, that what ever Catholick wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpeak, is Catholick Faith: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that they puzle, and are unreſolved in Faith, where ever they are unreſolved: which although it be a pittiful piece of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs to think, yet is not he the only man that rides upon this Hobby-Horſe. <hi>Taylor, Poole, Moore, Hammond, Pierſe, Whitby, Owen,</hi> all of them mount upon the ſame
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57867:64"/>Steed, and one cannot tell which of them is the wiſeſt. Faith is before and antecedent: Faith is the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto us by his Church, uninterrupted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeding from generation to generation: Faith is plain and ſingle, and equally common to all. But School-learning is ambiguous, doubtful, various, intricate, invented by men, divers and contradictory, and a meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our Chriſtianity, which is a thouſand years older than it, and may in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubſiſt yet a thouſand years more, after that School-learning is quite vaniſht out of the world. Are all our Anti-catholick adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſo blind, that they cannot ſee this? It is ſtrange to me, that they ſhould not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all the ſaid Popiſh Doctors and their Diſciples remain peaceably together, in the ſame profeſſion of Faith all the world over, notwithſtanding theſe their claſhing Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies. For how could they otherwiſe call them all Popiſh Doctors. Faith is one thing, and the declarations of it may be many. One ſingle truth revealed to us by our Lord and his Church from him, may give Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wits occaſion to raiſe up a hundred queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the modes, circumſtances, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of it. And theſe various concluſions of men, both thoſe which declare Faith, and thoſe which ſuperadd other new things over
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57867:65"/>and beyond it, are Philoſophies commonly called theology, expoſed in the Schools unto the tryal of wits; where they are ſo ſure to ſuffer oppoſition, that not one concluſion in a hundred eſcapes it. So that their puzling about curioſities of their own, doth nothing at all concern either faith or faithful men. Thoſe that love it, let them take their paſtime in that puzling work: but they do not think to be ſaved by it. And they who never know or hear of it, may haply be the better Chriſtians for that, but never the worſe? I believe Jeſus our Lord to be preſent in the Euchariſt, and worſhip him there, and offer up unto Almighty God all my neceſſities with Jeſus my Lord, there figured by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as crucified before us; all this my Faith teaches me; and all this I do, and can do well enough, though I never either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or conſider, how his humanity is united, how it is preſent, how it terminates our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; all which concerns me nothing. Let the curious ſpeculate ſuch like things, and be never the wiſer, but only in a few uncouth words. I am ſatisfied, if I do my duty in ſimplicity and innocency; that duty that is before all theſe ſpeculations one and the ſame, and remains the ſame after them. By a vulgar and familiar example, I may haply be better underſtood. The Doctor both
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57867:65"/>ſees, and walks, and ſleeps; and ſo do I my ſelf. And yet our School-men are puzled, and mightily unreſolved about all theſe things, how they are done, and cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly agree. They cannot conclude, whether our ſeeing be wrought by introreception or extramiſſion of raies; ſome ſay the one way, ſome the other, ſome both. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell aſſuredly, whether viſion be effected in the cryſtaline humour or nerves; they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not what thing this ſight or viſion is, nor how it is conveighed or lodged within for future dreams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved how we think or how the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us gets ſo ſtrangely within us, or how it lyes there couched, or how it circles ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in our ſpirits, or what phyſical thing our thinking is, whether appearances or only motion, and what, and where thoſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and what the moover: They cannot with any uniformity declare how we walk, how the various ſtrings lye for this motion; where they are knit together; what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, impulſe, or impreſſion ſets the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to move; and how that impulſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57867:66"/>whence it comes, and where it reſides; what is that thing which ſo ſtrangely ſilences all the ſences? where thoſe ſpirits retire, who keep daily Centinal in thoſe Cinque-Ports; and which are their Bed-Chambers? what do they when they thus retire; and how they reſt; how they iſſue next morning each to his own place, without any director, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here School-men puzle, here they are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, here they diſpute and differ. But what then? Cannot I therefore ſee, nor walk, nor think, nor ſleep? No, it ſeems, till the School-men reſolve: ſay you ſo? Let them never reſolve them, and I will try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I can ſleep at my time, and walk, and think, and look about me. Even juſt ſo it is here, for the dictates and axioms of Faith were before School-mens doubts and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will be ever the ſame, what ever they reſolve or doubt of.</p>
               <p>§ 9. <hi>The ſence of thoſe words,</hi> This is my Body, <hi>is doubted of, and interpreted now ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and ſeveral diſputes ariſe. What have Papiſts to rely upon, ſith the Fathers are themſelves as fallible as other men; neither are they aſſured that they have any Prieſts amongſt them for to conſecrate,</hi> &amp;c. If we can now but ſave our eyes, we are well. For we have but two or three motes more to trouble us. All is doubtful he ſays; doubtful, whether
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57867:66"/>we have any Prieſts or no; doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have any certain ſence to our words; doubtful whether we have any men to make ſence of them: doubtful whether we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truſt and aſſurance upon thoſe men. And what ſhall we do now? Surely he would have us either do, or not do ſomthing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I know not what. We cannot heed holy Fathers, for they are fallible and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. We cannot believe Proteſtants, for they are doubtful men, and divided, and unſettled in their opinions of this point. We cannot regard Dr. <hi>Still.</hi> for he is a doubt-making man, and blunders and ſettles upon nothing, and not certain himſelf, according to what he ſpeaks here of Prieſts out of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> whether he be a Miniſter or no, or a Clark, or a Chriſtian, or ſo much as a <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> I think we had beſt keep our ſelves where we are, who doubt nothing at all, and leave the Doctor to play at his Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-buff all alone. If Infidelities and Cavils of men, diſputes and difficulties, ſurmiſed doubts, and vain ſophiſmes muſt annul our Faith; then can we not poſſibly in this world either keep or receive any Faith in God at all. And Chriſt our Lord muſt needs then have appeared among us on this our Earth in vain. For both himſelf, and all the whole truth he delivered us, was in his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57867:67"/>time, and all following ages contradicted round about, and oppoſed, and rendred thereby doubtful by Jews and Pagans; and no leſs by thoſe people, who Apoſtatized from that Catholick Society, than any other their outward and forrein Adverſaries.

               <p>§ 10. The reſidue of this Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraies our third Catholick Idol. Saints namely, and their invocation. There be but three or four words in it of ſubſtance (if a falſhood may be ſaid indeed to ſubſiſt at all) dilated ſo by his pretty rhetorick, as if he had a mind to teach young Lawyers how to plead in a falſe cauſe. <hi>The Heathens, ſaith he, were not blamed by Chriſtian Doctors, for their ill choice of worſhip,</hi> Venus <hi>for example, or</hi> Vulcan, <hi>who were wretches; but for giving divine honour to any but the true God, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do.</hi> Here are two untruths, and both notorious ones. For neither do Catholicks give divine honour to Saints, their fellow Servants and Domeſticks of Faith; neither is it true, that antient Chriſtian Doctors did not blame the Heathens for their ill choyce of worſhip; as monuments yet extant, various and weighty monuments do witneſs, both in St. <hi>Auſtins Civitate Dei,</hi> and elſewhere. <hi>Wiſe Heathens worſhiped one God ſupreme, heeding the reſt as inferiour powers under him, as Papiſts do their Saints.</hi> Theſe be two more falſhoods, as is already declared in part.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57867:69"/>For neither are Saints, any inferiour powers to help us from themſelves, as the Sun, Moon, or <hi>Mercury;</hi> but friends of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and welwiſhers to their Brethren on Earth, ready as <hi>Onias, Job, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and all the good Angels, both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and rejoyce at their converſion and peace. Neither did the wiſe Heathens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one God ſupreme, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly teſtifies in his Epiſtle to the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome;</hi> where he tells them, that even the Pagan Philoſophers whom Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> calls the <hi>wiſer Heathens, held the truth in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, that they did not glorifie nor worſhip the ſupreme God; that they became as vain in their thoughts and deeds, as any, even the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſer ſort of them, that pretending to be wiſe, or wiſer Heathens, they became ſtarke Noddies; that they transformed Gods truth, diſcerned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his works of Creation into a lye; and that they worſhiped and ſerved the Creature <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and not the Creator.</hi> I know well enough that <hi>Varro,</hi> with ſome others of the Heathens about <hi>Rome,</hi> where all ſorts of Idols were brought together for the renown and pomp of that conquering City, began to plead thus, and excuſe their Idolatry, as the Doctor has learned by him here to do. But did St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> admit that plea? or was there ever any Chriſtian, who oppoſed it not, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57867:69"/>with all our holy Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? <hi>What</hi> ſubordination was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Egyptian, Cyrian,</hi> and <hi>Chaldean</hi> Idols; or what Country ever was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, who looked not upon their own Idol-God as Supreme? <hi>Papiſts build Churches to Saints, offer Sacrifice to Saints, as Heathens to thoſe dieties.</hi> Two more falſities. Papiſts do neither of theſe. And the Doctor might be aſhamed to talk thus. Have not Proteſtants, St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, St <hi>Peters</hi> Church, St. <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> St. <hi>Steven,</hi> St. <hi>Johns</hi> Church, and the like, even as Catholicks have? And did ever any Catholick in the world, ſay, or write, or profeſs to offer Sacrifice to Saints? <hi>They uſe a formal invocation of them.</hi> One more: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal invocation, is only an invocation of the cauſe, who is to give the bleſſing, grace, or favour petitioned, and from whom all good things do flow, and not of him who requeſts it. <hi>Popiſh Hymns and Anthems in honour of Saints, are not only Rhetorical Apoſtrophees, uſed by ſome of the Greek Fathers, or poetical flouriſhes, as thoſe of</hi> Damaſcus, Prudentius, Paulinus, Ambroſius, <hi>or only general wiſhes, that Saints would pray for us, of which are ſome inſtances in good Authors, or any devout Aſſemblies, at the Monuments of Martyrs, which were uſual in antient times.</hi> They are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57867:70"/>indeed not only this, becauſe they are alſo and principally formal invocations of the moſt glorious God, as any one may perceive, who will pleaſe to read over our Catholick Hymns, for Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Virgins, in the Breviary, as the Doctor (more ſhame for him thus to talk) hath done him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

            <p>THe Doctor pretends, Sir, in his third Chapter to deſcend unto ſome parcels of our morality: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us that five pieces of our belief and practice are main hindrances of a good life and devotion: namely, our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (as he calls it) of penance, of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, of prayers in an unknown tongue, of the efficacy of ſacraments, and of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of ſcripture. His reaſons for all this, or his cunning leiger ways of perverting all theſe things, his inſincerity therein, and notable diſſimulation, you ſhall hear by and by. For perceiving now, that after I have ſet down the ſum of his text in groſs, I am forced to repeat it all again by retail, ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby both time and paper needleſly, I muſt content my ſelf to give you his text onely in parts, with my ſhort comment ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to each parcel as I go. But give me
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57867:72"/>leave to tell you, Sir, thus much in general aforehand, that all this his whole Chapter is ſo palpably uncharitable and unjuſt, that no honeſt underſtanding Reader, what pleaſure ſoever he took himſelf in writing it, can read it over without diſdain and grief. What is this world come to? and where are we? and what ſtrange things do we ſee and hear daily? This one book of Dr. Still. is to me ſuch a world of wonders, that I ſhall not hereafter ever marvel any more at any lie or ſlander, that I ſhall know impoſed by any whatever wicked man, upon his neighbour. Has the fool ſaid in his heart, there is no God, no providence at all, no care or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be uſed towards men? Are all things lawful that any one ſhall luſt to do or ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his neighbour? no compaſſion, no truth any more? God help our innocent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.

Holy Goſpel, and all our ſpiritual books, wherein our ſubſtantial religion is contained, both thoſe of antient times, and of our later writers, as Granada, Thomas a Kempis, S. Bonaventure, Parſons Reſolutions, Biſhop Sales, Drexellius, Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, and others, do all of them preſs and urge this Catholick duty of interiour renovation, ſanctification, and conformity to our Lord Jeſus as the main end of his appearance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. And Catholicks themſelves know, that it is their onely care and fear, their deſire and ſtudy ſo to do; ſuch men to live, and ſuch to die, as our Lord would have us. For this end we ſay our daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with our hymns and canticles, for this end we meditate; for this end we faſt and chaſtiſe our bodies, for this we do penance, make reſtitution, give alms, frequent ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all that we endeavour according to our poor abilities, Gods good counſels and holy grace aſſiſting us.

                  <hi>Eckius,</hi> and his fellow Catholicks, who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Martin Luther and his Proteſtant-refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when it firſt roſe up; may there clearly ſee that this interiour ſanctity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and holineſs of life, is the one great Catholick point, ſtoutly maintained againſt thoſe wild and diſſolute Reformers, who began now to corrupt the world with that curſed opinion of theirs, that <hi>faith alone is ſufficient to ſalvation.</hi> And what a ſtrange man is this Dr. Stillingfleet! If any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of our men, had objected to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; that in their reformation-way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther penance, nor contrition, nor ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor renovation of life is needful, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt Maſters of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who taught and maintained openly, and in the eyes of this very Sun, that nothing is neceſſary to ſalvation, but <hi>onely to believe,</hi> and by that naked faith to apply Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to themſelves, all interiour ſanctification being both impoſſible and needleſs; he had ſaid no more than truth, and what he might eaſily have proved out of the firſt Reformers principles; however I hope not maintained now by many of our wiſer Proteſtants in England, who notwithſtanding remain ſtill in that reformation which was chalked out for them by ſuch wicked Leaders. But now to lay upon Catholicks that wicked doctrine
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57867:73"/>of Reformers, oppoſed now a whole hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years by our Catholick Divines, is a deſperate confidence, befitting none but men wholly unconſcionable. Let them keep their own dirt to themſelves, and not throw it into our faces, however they begin now to be weary and aſhamed of it. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of holineſs, ſobriety, and juſtice, are inſignificant to them, who have hitherto even from the very cradles of this unlucky re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation publickly defended them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant; and not to us, who have ſtill maintained, that they are the very all in all of Chriſtianity. I have troubled my ſelf ſome while to think, what ſhould move Dr. Still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to invent this ſlander. Some word or other he muſt pervert; but I cannot conclude what it ſhould be. Perhaps he may take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from hence: that whereas there be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things concurring to our purification after ſin, as Gods grace, and our diſlike of our own ill deeds, fear of Gods wrath and puniſhment, grief for his love and favour forfeited, an humble confeſſion, purpoſe of amendment, and renovation of life; ſome Schoolmen have amongſt their other curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, conſidered into which of theſe many things may our juſtification be principally attributed, as the principal virtue and cauſe of it under God. For God who created us
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57867:74"/>without our ſelves, will not redeem us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our ſelves. And if any one in his philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy have ſaid, that confeſſion and ſorrow have the chiefeſt influence on our fide, that may be enough for Dr. Still to ſay as here he does, that we make confeſſion and contrition all in all, and renovation of life nothing. Or perhaps becauſe Catholick Doctors have taught, that confeſſion, together with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, may ſometimes be ſo great and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial at the laſt hour, that evil men may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by find mercy with God, as the good thief did, although they have no further leaſure to mend and renew their lives; therefore does this man conclude, that with us confeſſion with contrition is ſufficient, without any more ado. Whence ſoever he concludes or gathers it, he knows beſt himſelf. But this I know, that it is an abominable ſlander. And if all his readers were as skilful in our Catholick religion as we our ſelves who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, he would not have dared to ſpeak theſe things, deſpairing then of finding any credit either with man, woman, or child.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>They of the Church of Rome need little to heed a good life, who can have their ſins ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated in Purgatory by the prayers of the living, which is a doctrine very pleaſing to rich men, but uncomfortable to the poor.</hi> Pretty ſtuff! And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57867:74"/>need not then any man heed either to have patience in afflictions, or do his duty, becauſe another prays to God either that he may do ſo, or find mercy if he have done otherwiſe? Or muſt he needs be negligent of himſelf to day, becauſe he hopes good people will pray for him to morrow, when he cannot help himſelf? Souls departed are by our Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity believed to be now out of the place and way of merit: for there is neither art, nor induſtry, nor any good work to be done in the grave, whether we all haſten. And if friends on earth, where Gods favour may by our dutiful compliance be obtained, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their dead to Gods mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; this ſurely cannot make thoſe friends careleſs of themſelves while they remain here living. All men know that it is not enough for our entrance into heaven to cry, Lord, Lord; which is the voice of thoſe who think that onely faith ſaves; but the will of God who is in heaven is to be fulfilled by every one that ſhall enter there. And yet it is good and pleaſing, and profitable notwithſtanding to cry and ſupplicate unto our Lord God, with all earneſtneſs of heart, both for our ſelves and friends. <hi>But the poor are then in a ſad condition, and the rich man may eaſilier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of heaven, than a camel through a needles eye, by procuring Maſſes for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57867:75"/>their Souls.</hi> Who told this man, that the Souls of the poor are not prayed for in the Catholick Church? He onely thinks ſo. And he thinks amiſs therein, as he loves to do. Whence doth he gather that the rich go to heaven ſo eaſily in our eſteem by Maſſes? This he thinks too: Perhaps he does: For I am much deceived, if he do not utter many a falſhood which he knows to be ſuch, before he utters it. At leaſt none of ours ever told him the one nor the other: and what we believe or do our ſelves he may eaſily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and we have had already ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his ignorance therein, or ſome worſer miſdemeanor.

Poor <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>'s may by their cold, hunger, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, here on earth patiently endured, ſatisfie for their humane frailties ſo far with God here, that after this life, having no ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing to account for, they may chance not to need any farther help. But the rich men of the world will not eaſily be brought unto thoſe many voluntary penances and mortifications, which their ſenſualities exact, unto their expiation and peace with God. It were a happy thing, if they would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57867:75"/>be perſwaded in their life-time, to diſtribute part of their goods unto the poor of God, the orphans and widows, their lame, old, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, feeble neighbours, as they uſed to do formerly in Catholick times. But if infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the contagion of ſin and ſinners, they will not be moved to this: yet a charitable diſtribution at their death, though it be a late offering, it is better than none at all. And ſeveral prayers poured forth to God for them after they are departed hence, though they may not perhaps equal their condition to the Soul of a poor believing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yet will alms-deeds plead their cauſe before God, and prayers will not be in vain. Make your ſelves friends, ſaith our Lord, of the mammon of iniquity, that when you fail, they may receive you into eternal taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles. And although it be ſurer, and a more certain way to make thoſe friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and continually, all our whole life time; yet are not they excluded from ſome benefit thereof, who make them late, and at their laſt hour. For they who receive tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things out of charity in God, are obliged now in the ſame charity to repay ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; and all other ſpiritual recompence is now out of ſeaſon, ſave onely prayer and hearty good wiſhes, which are never in vain before God. And it were much to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57867:76"/>that Mr. Still. would ceaſe at length to make jeſts of ſacred Goſpel, and apply it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to his own heart and ſoul, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our holy Lord. Perhaps he would not then endeavour any more to inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or court promotion by this wicked trade of defaming his innocent neighbours, Gods ancient and renowned ſervants: It is neither impoſſible to God that a camel or cable rope ſhould paſs through a needles eye, nor yet that a rich man ſhould be ſaved, if he will bend himſelf to his duty.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>Prayers in an unknown tongue hinder all ſincerity of devotion among Papiſts.</hi> Here the Author wriggles and winds himſelf, like a ſnake in a buſh; ſpeaking ſometimes as if people knew not what their Prieſt ſays; and ſometimes again, as if they knew not what themſelves pray, confounding all things that he may more freely ſport himſelf. <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> faith he, <hi>to know what we pray, than not. Chriſtian prayers are not to be uſed like charms. God underſtands more than one language. The more people underſtand, the better they pray. Why ſome pray and not others, if ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and not others? Why ſhould any pray, but he that underſtands?</hi> All this is very true, but what and whom does it concern? <hi>People may as well pray at the chiming of Bells, as at

And what harm is it if a Chriſtian do pray at the chiming of Bells? Hundreds of good Catholicks pray at the ſtriking of the clock daily: and what then? what harm is this? But his <hi>chiming jargon</hi> put together makes the merriment. If a Catholick prieſt appearing among the Chriſtian flock met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to pray and meditate, and offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and all their friends to God, joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them, and place himſelf between them and God, to offer to him his own and their neceſſities, to ſacrifice for their peace, as our Lord in his laſt ſupper appointed, to meditate and pray with them for himſelf, and all the people, placed in their humble and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent poſture in the Church, what chimes or jargon is there here? But when a man ſpeaks againſt he knows not what, he muſt needs ſay he knows not what againſt it. For Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, whoſe devotion he here derides, pray and meditate both privately all alone in their own cloſets or oratories, and publickly in their Synaxis or aſſembly at Liturgy. Their private devotions take them up an hour or two every day in the week, wherein they keep peculiar prayers and meditations, about the creation, and Gods providence, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57867:77"/>paſſion, myſteries of grace, the duties of life, vice and vertues, Gods mercies and judgments, mans miſery and weakneſs, puniſhments and rewards eternal: And all theſe prayers made either in their own tongue or no words at all, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in any of this our doctors talk. And their conventual converſe with God in their Synaxis or Maſs, is no otherwiſe. For there met all together, they do but meditate and pray as they did before, but now in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, either without any words, as was moſt familiar in antient times, or with words, as now is more uſual; underſtanding well enough, both the thoughts and aſpirations of their own hearts, and the words of their lips, if they utter any. Onely there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired here, a little more inſtruction; that they may conceive both what the Prieſt does with them and for them: and alſo how to comply and joyn their hearts with his; that they may all unanimouſly endeavour in this their ſilent, and yet buſie and earneſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with God, to offer up themſelves with the div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne ſacrifice, unto their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and peace. For the Prieſts great work there, is rather viſible actions than au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible words: and whether he ſpeak engliſh or latin, it is all one to them who can ſeldom hear him, and attend not ſo much to his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57867:77"/>words, as deeds, whenever they caſt their eyes that way. And that this is the capital devotion of all antient Chriſtians in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxis, and not any few prayers read in our ears by a Miniſter in a Pew, has been amply demonſtrated by Catholick Doctors, in all the languages of Europe at this day. Their Synaxis was never any hearing or fitting bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but ſuch a poſture of humiliation, where every heart ſubmits, every tongue confeſſes, and every knee bows to God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our onely hope and refuge. And if the doctour is ignorant of all this, let him turn Catholick that he may underſtand it better.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>The efficacy of ſacraments in the Church of Rome, depending upon bare admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration without any preparation of mind, is another great enemy to Piety. For their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confer grace ex opere operato, as the Council of Trent has defined. This being ſo, what need is there of any preparation of mind, by the exerciſe of faith, prayer, repentance, any ſtrict examination, or endeavour of raiſing our ſelves unto any worthy uſe of Sacraments. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion will never be more eaſily baniſhed out of the world, than by a perſwaſion that grace and its comfortable effects may be had without it, without prayer, without endeavour of a holy life, without mortification, and watchfulneſs after
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57867:78"/>the benefits which Chriſts life and death obtained for us.</hi> This is a goodly and very plauſible harrangue, if it had any foundation or truth in it. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ever any Council, or Doctor, or Catholick man, either ſay or believe that our Lords Sacraments do confer grace unto the receiver, without any of their preparation, or diſpoſition of heart towards them? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any one. But all the whole world of Catholicks prepare themſelves for them, with all their whole utmoſt care and endeavour, believing all they can poſſibly do, is yet too little; unleſs Gods mercy and goodneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing accept freely their poor pitiful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. And of the multitude of their Prieſts in the Catholick world, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of a thouſand ſo deſperate, but he ſpends one hour in prayer, recollection, and examination of himſelf, before he dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Altar. And that one, if any ſuch there be, who ſhall neglect this his due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, ſo that he communicate unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if by timely and ſerious repentance he do not recover himſelf, will harden by degrees, and be loſt irrevocably. Thus ſome do fall away, either openly or occultly; and theſe occult apoſtates are eaſily known by this, that they are wholly taken up in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and ſenſual pleaſures, not relliſhing now any ſpiritual employments in their cloſet.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57867:78"/>Thus affairs ſtand with Catholicks in this buſineſs. And what can we then think of this Doctor, who tells the world ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious untruth againſt them. <hi>But is it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined that the Sacraments of the new law confer grace ex opere operato?</hi> This is very true, indeed it is ſo defined. But what is the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of theſe latin words, <hi>ex opere operato:</hi> not ſurely this, <hi>without diſpoſition, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or examination, or devotion.</hi> This is not the engliſh of that latin: but this, <hi>By the very work done;</hi> which gives us quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce and meaning. That thing avails by the very work done, which carries with it ſelf a power and virtue, if the work be done, to avail and profit us. Our corporeal meat ſuſtains our bodies <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> or by the very work of eating, done, and completed in all its operations: we all know this. And yet none of us think, that we need not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have any appetite or diſpoſition in our bodies, when we eat; or that we need not keep our bodies clean, or ſound, or health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that our food may be unto us the ſavour of life unto life, and good nouriture and ſtrength. And the Doctor if he had not ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died rather to miſconſtrue all things, than interpret any thing right, might eaſily have diſcerned the true and connatural meaning of the words, by their very place and poſture in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57867:79"/>the canon cited by himſelf out of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine Council. For there it is defined and openly declared againſt the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, who exalted faith, onely and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary faith, unto the excluſion of all other good works and uſe of ſacraments; that our Lords ſacraments inſtituted for our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and comfort, are both profitable and neceſſary unto that end of conveighing grace and ſanctity into us, and that by a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conferred upon them by the divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Inſtitutor of them. This the Council there defines; oppoſing the virtue of ſacraments, ſhewing it ſelf, and ſtreaming into the heart of the worthy receiver, in <hi>the very thing done,</hi> unto the bare and naked faith of thoſe lewd reformers: even as the ſad Council ſtill up and down in all their Seſſions did maintain the neceſſity of prayer, alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, mortification, penance, juſtice, truth, ſatisfaction, ſobriety, continence, purity of life, meekneſs, and all Chriſtian virtues, againſt that wicked Solifidian hereſie, which they with all their force endeavoured utterly to root out <hi>Siquis dixerit,</hi> ſaith the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil there, <hi>per ipſa novae legis ſacramenta ex opere operato non conferri gratiam, ſed fidem ſolam divinae promiſſionis ad gratiam conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendam ſufficere, anathema ſit.</hi> Who can be ſo blind as not to ſee here plainly declared,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57867:79"/>that our Lords ſacraments have a ſanctifying power either in them or with them, and therefore not to be contemned or neglected, under any pretence of faith, which although it be good and lively with the concurrence of other good works and graces, yet is it without them unprofitable and dead: And amongſt thoſe good helps and quickners of our faith, are the ſacraments by our Lord himſelf inſtituted, none of the leaſt or mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and therefore to be received with all love and reverence, as the very conduits of divine grace <hi>ex opere operato</hi> derived into our ſouls from thence. Here then we cannot prudently imagine, that our Catholick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the Council exclude our devotion, diſpoſition of mind exerciſe of faith, prayer and repentance, ſtrict examination, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a holy life, mortification and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, all which they had elſewhere eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; but to ſuppoſe rather and include them all: becauſe all theſe are oppoſed unto <hi>faith alone,</hi> as neceſſary preparatives for the receiving of that virtue which ſacraments confer. And the Council rather choſe to expreſs themſelves, when they would ſpeak of the powerful operation of ſacraments, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this general way, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> than any other more particular manner, that they might declare themſelves in words acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57867:80"/>and indifferent unto both the great ſchools in the Catholick world, whereof though both of them agree that grace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>by the thing done,</hi> yet one teaches that the ſaid grace or virtue is inherent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal, the other that it is extrinſecal one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and aſſiſtant to the ſacraments: And therefore would not the Council ſay, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments contain grace, but that they cauſe it <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by their ſacramental appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto the faithful and worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a long received opinion among ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> ſaith the doctor, <hi>that ſacraments of the old law in conferring grace, depend upon opus operantis, the faith and devotion of the receiver; but thoſe of the new confer grace ex opere opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, without any diſpoſition, internal motion, or preparation of mind.</hi> O ſhameleſs ignorance! very fain would this man be thought a deep ſchoolman, who never penetrated any one ſchoolman in his life, as it appears ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his ſimple talk, nor yet underſtands them, either what they ſay, or who they are. Inſomuch that I am half perſwaded that he takes Lillies Grammar for one of the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Is that an opinion, a long received opinion among ſchoolmen? How long for Gods ſake? and among how many of them? All of them for certain. Nay name ten:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57867:80"/>for there are many hundreds of ſchoomen, and all maſters, although not all inſtitutors or ſounders of the chair; and as ſimply as <hi>I</hi> ſit here, I have been a piece of one my ſelf: which I now ſpeak, Sir, that this doctor, if he come by any chance to hear of this my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle poſtil, might not fear that he has got ſome petty abecedarian Commentator, who largely explaining his eaſier texts, ſhould paſs by his more grave and harder ones, untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nay let him name onely one, and it ſhall ſuffice. The margent of his book over againſt this his ſchool-aſſertion, was bare, and able to hold one mans name at leaſt: and yet he leaves it quite empty. He does not quote ſo much as any one ſchooman, for the juſtification of this his aſſertion moſt uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably falſe. And although it nothing concerns us in our defence of faith, what opinion is amongſt ſchoolmen, who have raiſed an art of their own, an art of talking, defending and proving things never revealed unto us, or any ways edifying to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet if there had been any ſuch opinion among ſchoolmen, then had not Dr. Still. been unconſcionable, however he had been impertinent. Schoolmen do indeed agree unanimouſly, that the ſacraments of the law of Moſes conferred no grace at all. So the whole four ſchools of S. Thomas, and Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57867:81"/>Aureolus and Darandus: and all the many Doctors of them teach; however ſome of them ſpeak otherwiſe of circumciſion, which was from the fathers. But this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple talk, <hi>that ſacraments of the old law confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red grace by the diſpoſition of the receiver, the new without it:</hi> as I never heard it before, ſo does not he know where to find it, except it be in ſome writings of Mr. Farnaby a late Schoolmaſter in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Schoolmen are much puzled, and cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree how ſacraments confer grace, whether as a moral or phyſical cauſe, whether as inherent or aſſistant, whether as an inſtrument or a ſign,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I</hi> care not if I help the Doctor a little, not in the ſchoolmens puzling, but his own. The ſchools of St. Thomas, and all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of it, in declaring the efficacy of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (which all Chriſtians equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) teach, that they work grace as a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical cauſe, and as inherent, and as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it under God. The whole ſchool of Scotus teaches, that they work it as a ſign onely, as aſſiſtant, and moral cauſe. And if the Doctor pleaſe either to diſpute for St. Thomas his way in Scotus his ſchool, or for Scotus his way in the ſchool of St. Thomas; he will find that they do not fumble, or puzle, or ſtand unreſolved what to ſay; but that they ſtruggle ſtoutly, and maintain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57867:81"/>and defend invinceably, both of them their own proper ways and opinions, without ever yielding one inch of ground to the oppoſer. And though the matter be of ſmall importance, yet the glory or ſhame of overcoming or being overcome, is thought by them all to be no ſmall matter. Never did Aeneas and Turnus ruſh with a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſhock and and reſolution, than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do; <hi>Rumpuntur neſcia vinci Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> and all for an opinion amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, affirmed by one, and gainſaid as reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely by the other. Dr. Still. utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in theſe affairs, may ſay as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that they fumble, and puzzle, and are wholly unreſolved. But all this ſignifies no more, but that he is wholly ignorant of what he ſpeaks. <hi>Caſſander and Arnoldus, both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, do hold it to be a Catholick doctrine, that Sacraments do no good without the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the receiver, and condemn the other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome amongſt them, as wicked.</hi> Here the man names us two of our Doctors who hold it to be a Catholick doctrine, that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do no good without the devotion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the receiver; which we all believe. But he names us not any one, who ever ſaid it was a Catholick doctrine, that they do all their good without any diſpoſition or devotion of the receiver; which is the opinion he has
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57867:82"/>put upon us all this while, without any fear or wit. Did Caſſander and Arnoldus hold right or wrong? Were they with us or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us? If againſt us in faith, then were they not Catholicks themſelves: if with us, then is all Dr. Still's diſcourſe againſt us here, both impertinent and falſe. But <hi>I</hi> perceive well enough he neither knows what faith means, nor what it is to be a Catholick. A moſt certain truth it is, that Sacraments do no good to the receiver without a congruous diſpoſition and devotion in him. And all food, whether ſpiritual or corporal, if it do no good, muſt needs do ſome harm. And this is ſomething more than he tells to be ſaid by Arnoldus and Caſſander.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Another enemy to piety is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Scripture, and keeping from people Gods holy word, which might direct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them.</hi> This charge bears ſomething more of colour and appearance, than any or all the other four. And yet, things rightly underſtood, it is nothing elſe but a meer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and appearance. For all the whole fourteen hundred years before PRINT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING was found out, in all which time thoſe ſacred writings were ſo rare, that not one of a thouſand could get them, it was the labour and obligation of a Prieſt ſtill night
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57867:82"/>and day to read and ſtudy thoſe books, and not for himſelf one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which reaſon the Bible was then called <hi>Liber Sacerd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tis,</hi> the Prieſts book: but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and above all, to collect from thence what he thought might beſt conduce unto devotion and piety towards God. And this was not hard for them to do, after they had once by their united induſtry gathered out of the ſaid Bible a complete Breviary for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For this lying now by them, eaſily could they turn unto any thing they ſhould have need of on any occaſion. Thus they did before PRINTING was found out. But no ſuch thing is ever done by Miniſters, who leave their people both to buy themſelves a book, and uſe it when they have it as they pleaſe. And now ſince the Invention of PRINTING, peoples hands are ſo filled with holy goſpels, pſalms, hymns, canticles, holy hiſtories, prayers meditations, manuels and the like contents of holy ſcrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing at all is there in faith or good manners, wherewith they are not as fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted as their Clergy. And all this, as it is nothing elſe but Gods word, ſo is Gods
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57867:83"/>word nothing elſe but this. Therefore is not Gods word prohibited or kept from peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Church of Rome, as the doctor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. Indeed the whole letter of ſcripture as it lies, is permitted to none, but ſuch as have abilities to uſe it. But what then? Even our ordinary people have more now, than they had in the beſt ages of Chriſtianity, who digeſting well, what they had, ſaved their ſouls by it, and that is enough. And the little they had, was all that is to be had for that purpoſe. I have, Sir, often had occaſion to ſpeak of this ſubject: and muſt be fain now in this my ſpeedy haſte, to borrow ſome help from my words elſewhere delivered, whoſe ſence, though it be perfect enough in my mind, yet if I do not help my ſelf thence, I ſhall ſpend time which I cannot now ſpare, in thinking how to word and expreſs it to you. Thus then it is written of this buſineſs in one place Catholicks have the ſum of ſcripture both for hiſtory and dogm, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their own language, ſo much as may make for their ſalvation, diſintangled from the tropes and ſchemes. and ambiguous phraſes, wherein it was firſt written, good orders being ſet and inſtituted for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency therein; the ſum of all divine truths belonging to Chriſtianity, and the whole counſel of God for their direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57867:83"/>this have Catholicks full and clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered them out of holy writ, and all their whole duty both towards God and their neighbour, in their own language. Nor are they ignorant of any thing that may apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain either to ſobriety, juſtice or piety. The whole ſacred ſtory of our Lords incarnation, paſſion and aſcenſion, all his ſacraments, all the whole counſels and precepts of God, which may concern ſalvation, all his promiſes and threats, they have them all made known unto them, clear and diſintangled from the various tropes and ſchemes of rhetorick or logick, ſo interwoven in the ſacred authors writings, that it puzzles the greateſt clerk with all his literature and ſcience to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the connexions, tranſitions of diſcourſe, objections, amb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>guous phraſes, hebraiſms, and greciſms, and ſuch-like obſcurities that occur; or to find out the drift and purpoſe and meaning of places: which things do and have too too often cauſed miſtakes and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the world. And all the ſacred truths which it concerns them to practiſe, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſtill been put in mind of by their prieſts both in private and publick, to their daily edification. Nor was it ever the faſhion in Chriſtianity to throw the bible among people, and ſo leave them to themſelves, as the Reformers have done. Moſt certain it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57867:84"/>is, that the word and will and counſel of God, conſiſts not in letters and ſyllables, much leſs in the tropes and modes of rhetorick and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which do variouſly obſcure the ſacred writ above all books that have ever been pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by man; but in the ſence and meaning, which, is eaſily and ſecurely conveighed. It is no hard matter, for example, to underſtand, that all men, both Jews and Gentiles, who have ever come to the knowledge of Chriſt, were beholding to Gods mercy, meerly to Gods mercy for that their converſion and the life of grace they had by it; which is the ſcope of S. Pauls epiſtle to the Romans: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to give an account how S. Paul dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and proves this truth in that his epiſtle, what arguments he doth either eſtabliſh or refute, what modes and figures he uſes, what tropes and rhetorical ſchemes be in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, how he paſſes from one thing to another in his diſcourſe, and by what art of ratiocination the context of his whole letter is knit together, this is neither eaſie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor neceſſary to any mans ſalvation to diſcern. And yet the epiſtle without all this knowledge cannot be underſtood, or rightly apprehended. And if it be conceived falſly, miſtakes and hereſies will riſe. The will and mind and word of God, this all people are to know, what he hath commanded, what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57867:84"/>what threatned, what promiſed, what our Lord did and ſuffered for us, and what we are to ſuffer and do for him, that we may be partakers of his glory. But the humanity and philoſophy that lies couched in holy writ, vulgar people neither can nor have need to dive into it. Nor was the holy ſcripture ever penned or intended for the people immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but for the biſhops and prieſts of God, who are to watch over them for their good; and from their lips they are to receive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Chriſtians were ever fed like pigeons, by the mouth, until they were ſo fledg, that they could now fly &amp; feed themſelves. Once come to maturity, they may read what they pleaſe on Gods name, and the more they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to lection of holy ſcriptures, the better it is, ſo they apply all unto action and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their lives. And again, in an epiſtle of mine its written thus: I have heard many great proteſtant divines ingeniouſly acknowledge that divine comfort and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of life requiſite to ſalvation, which religion onely aims at, may with more perfection and leſs inconvenience be attained by the cuſtoms of the Roman Church, which gives the ſenſe life and meaning of Gods word unto people, without the husk of the formal letter; than by the way of Proteſtants, which exhibits it to people hidden under the hard ſhell, able to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57867:85"/>break peoples teeth Religion conſiſts not in reading but doing; to be had by heart, and not in the lips: that way is tedious and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, this fruitful and eaſie Chriſt our Lord drew a compendium of all divine duties into two words, the great apoſtle into one: and both of them made all to conſiſt in practice. If the ſeveral goſpels for every day in the year which are or may be in the hands of all Catholicks, the chief particles of divine epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, thoſe I mean which are of general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, books of ſacred inſtructions and meditations upon the myſteries of ſalvation, and ſpiritual treatiſes for all occaſions and uſes which be numberleſs, adjoyned to the rites of examination of conſcience; continual and daily uſe of prayer and faſting, and an orderly commemoration of the things our Lord hath wrought for us throughout the year, which all men by law are tied to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, may not give ſufficient acquaintance of what concerns ſalvation, and enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote people towards it, I am to ſeek what it is that can. Sure I am that the world was firſt converted without any books at all, and many millions of good Chriſtians both lived piouſly and died happily, who never ſaw the Bible. What further good may it do to read the letter of S. Pauls epiſtle to the Romans for example, or Corinthians, wherein are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57867:85"/>queſtions and caſes that are now quite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the world, and other theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſcourſes, which vulgar people can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand, nor are at all concerned to know. What more of good can accrew to any by the tranſlated letter of a book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of nine parts in ten concern not my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular either to practiſe, or ſo much as heat of, than by the meer ſubſtance of Gods will and my own duty once well underſtood, and daily applied unto action &amp; anſwerable good deeds? What is there now in England when the ſaid ſcripture letter is ſet open unto every eye, any more of peace or charity, piety or juſtice, than in former Catholick times when the ſubſtance of Gods word and will was given people in ſhort, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their duty prolixly preſt upon them? What did they do in thoſe antient Catholick times? They flock'd every day to their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, there to pay, meditate, and renew their good purpoſes: they ſung pſalms, hymns, and canticles day &amp; night all over the land; they built all our churches which we have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this day amongſt us, and as many more now razed &amp; pulled down; they founded and endowed our Univerſities, eſtabliſh'd our laws, ſet out tithes &amp; glebe land for the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, built hoſpitals, erected corporations; and in a word did all the good things which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57867:86"/>we find done by our forefathers for our good in this our native kingdom. But what do we now? what have we ſtill been doing ſince the reformation? <hi>quid agitur in Angliâ? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulitur de religione.</hi> Continually are we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and unmaking our religious rites, ſtill building and pulling down our opinions. Former Catholick Chriſtians practiſed, and we diſpute. They had a religion fixt, we are ſtill ſeeking one. They exerciſed themſelves in good works by the guidance of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, which led them towards them, and preſſed their duty; all theſe works we by our new way evacuate. They had the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of religion in their hearts, we the text in our lips. They had nothing to do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their lives to Gods will; all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to apply Gods word to our own faction. Let there be no longer a miſtake: the queſtion is not, whether people are to have Gods word or no; but whether that word conſiſt in the letter left to the peoples diſpoſal, or in the ſubſtance and meaning of it, urgently impoſed upon people for their practice. And we muſt ſtill and ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it is not Gods will or word, but the letter of ſcripture onely, which makes here-ticks: this may be depraved by men unto their own deſtruction, that cannot.</p>
               <p>So that when we come to a concluſion of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57867:86"/>theſe things; there is no ſuch Catholick do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, faith, or religion amongſt us, which preſcribes any of theſe thing put here in his third chapter upon the Roman Church. For firſt, our Catholick way is ſo far from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods word from the people, that it has been the only great endeavour of our Church and paſtors in all times and places, to derive Gods word and will in ſuch a manner unto people, that they may obſerve and keep it: however they will not permit the letter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly unto all hands without a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their ability and ſtayedneſs; even as they do not ſuffer all ſorts of men to come to holy communion without a licenſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their lives and perſons. Secondly, that our efficacy of ſacraments depends upon meer adminiſtration without any preparation of mind, is ſo falſe, that every Catholick boy and girl, arrived to years of diſcretion, will hiſs at it. Thirdly, that we pray in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, and know not what we ſay, is a calumny onely proper for the wiſe men of Gotam. Fourthly, that prayers for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after this life ended, do hinder our own holineſs and devotion in this preſent life, is a paradox fit onely for diſcourſe in a tavern or coffee-houſe over cups. Fifthly, that our ſacrament of penance with interiour contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficeth us without any amendment of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57867:87"/>life, or purpoſe towards it, is a ſlander which the doctor could not have vented with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe on any other ground but Billingſgate. He took it ſeems more pleaſure to ſhew an evil wit, than a good candid nature, which is a perfection more becoming him, and if I be not miſtaken by too much charity, more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in his courteous converſation with his neighbours, than in his written Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or books made againſt the Church of Rome; which are ſo falſe and injurious, that they cannot but hurt as well our Proteſtant neighbours who read and believe them, as poor innocent Catholicks, who diſlike and ſuffer them. And now, dear Sir, I bid you farwel the ſecond time.</p>

            <head>FANATICISM.</head>
            <p>I Am now, Sir, arrived to the Doctors merriment, a merriment peculiarly prophane, which has gained him much applauſe. He endeavours in his 4. Chapter to declare and prove, that the Church of Rome is fanatical; founded and ſupported on fanaticiſm. A merry theme and fit for a <hi>terrae filius.</hi> And I ſuppoſe here, that he means by the Church of Rome, not any material building of ſtone and morter, either the floar or walls, windows, pillars, ſteeple or weather-cock; nor yet any men or women, boys or girls in England, Ireland, France, or other countreys; but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith and religion proteſt all over the world, by ſuch as we now in England call Papiſts. For his readers both Catholick and Proteſtant, do underſtand him ſo to mean.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57867:88"/>And this religion and faith, he proves by ſuch arguments to be fanatical; as might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer fanaticiſm indifferently upon all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the earth, and all mankind; thus he ſpeaks. There were two men and as many more women in diſtant times and places, who pretended revelations about the unſpotted purity of the bleſſed Virgin Mary: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Catholick Church and faith fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. Secondly, one St. Catherin of Sena is ſaid to have had ſhining wounds in her body, and to ſmell the ſtench of lecherous men: therefore is their faith and Church fanatical. Thirdly, St. Gregory and St. Bede write of ſome apparitions: therefore is their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith fanatical. Fourthly, one Biſhop appointed a day to be holiday, another built a Church; and both were done by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: therefore is their faith and religion fanatical. Fifthly, St. Bennet, St. Francis, St. Dominick, St. Romewal, and St. Bruno founders of chief religious orders among them, had many ſymptoms of madmen, as to propheſie, to ſee angels, to neglect their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to be beaten and ſcoft at by men: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is their religion and Church fanatical. Sixthly, about four hundred years ago, there roſe a pernicious hereſie, which ſpread far, and cauſed much diſturbance, before they could ſilence and ſuppreſs it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> therefore is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57867:88"/>their Church and religion fanatical. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, St. Ignatius founder of the Society of Jeſuits was ſuch another fool as St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and laboured and ſuffered much, before he could get his order and rule approved by the Biſhop: therefore is the Roman Church fanatical. Eightly, one man among them of late printed a ſpiritual book wherein were ſome words and phraſes unuſual and hardly intelligible: therefore is the religion and Church of Rome fanatical. Ninthly, three men amongſt them in this laſt age, uttered blaſphemous words againſt the honour and prerogative of Kings, who are Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents upon earth: therefore is Catholick religion fanatical. All theſe hollow voices are to be heard and ſeen in this his Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Booth, for the recreation of ſuch as love it, iſſuing unto our great wonderment onely from the belly of one man, breaking wind in the midſt of it.</p>
            <p>§. 1. Let us ſee then how all this put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether does prove the Church of Rome, whoſe emblem it is intended, to be fanatical. It is an eaſie thing to act upon a ſtage the graveſt and ſobereſt man alive, in a drunken poſture. Wit without honeſty, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence without conſcience, can pervert and turn things upſide down at pleaſure. But a little reflection will ſet all ſtraight again.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57867:89"/>The Catholick Church and religion here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as fanatical, firſt, it has ſubſiſted by the confeſſion of our firſt reforming Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants even from the Apoſtles days, or very little after, ſpread all over Europ, Aſia and Africa. Secondly, it has been imbraced and owned by Kings and Princes, honourable Lawyers, learned Phyſicians, ſtout Captains. ſubtil Philoſophers, people innumerable, as the very ſands on the ſea ſhore. Thirdly, it made and framed the Laws both of our own Countrey, and every Chriſtian Kingdom. Fourthly, it built the many goodly Churches all over the world, even thoſe here, wherein now Proteſtants, the right owners excluded by violence, do preach. Fifthly, it ſet out the glebe land and tyths whereon they live. Sixthly, it founded our Corporations, raiſed our famous Univerſities, and furniſhed their Libraries with books. Seventhly, it has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icribed and delivered us the forms, not of the Sacraments onely, but of any ſort either of eccleſiaſtical or civil inſtalments. Eighthly, it has triumphed over Jews and Pagans, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their power and furious oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by Gods bleſſing and her own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, prudence and conſtancie; and laid aſleep the very hereſies that have riſen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her in all ages out of her own bowels. All theſe things, that I may ſpeak no more,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57867:89"/>are not the works of fanaticiſm, they are not the properties, power or geſtures of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks. Fanaticiſm riſes up ſuddenly, and dies like a muſhrom; utters a fond defiance, and ſo vaniſhes; deſtroys, but builds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, chatters a little like a moon calf, and is ſeen no more.</p>
            <p>§. 2. That our Doctor may proceed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doctor-like, he tells us in the begining of this his Chapter, what he means by fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm. <hi>By it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I underſtand an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick way of religion, or reſiſting authority under pretence of religion.</hi> This is his deſiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. But whether it be one definition or two, it is not eaſie to ſay. Indeed and truth, it is no definition at all; but onely an obſcure dark wording of things, ſo purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered, that he may put what he pleaſes in the circle of fanaticiſm, beſides himſelf. It is, ſaith he, <hi>an enthuſiaſtick way of religion.</hi> But what is enthuſiaſtick? what does <hi>way</hi> mean in theſe our affairs? and what is a way of religion? A definition ought to be plain and familiar, without either amphibology or trope; and more intelligible than the thing defined. This is not ſo. Enthuſiaſm in Greek is but the ſame thing as Inſpiration: Were then the Apoſtles and Prophets, who were inſpited, and taught that their inſpired way
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57867:90"/>of religion, the fanaticks here ſpoken of, or no? Secondly, what is meant by way? Is it a way chalked out for a man, by his juſt and legal guids; or a way invented by himſelf? This is a main buſineſs, and perhaps the very eſſence of fanaticiſm; and yet it is not here expreſt. Thirdly, what is a way of religion? Is it religion it ſelf, or ſome certain fanciful geſtures in the exerciſe of it, or ſome odd mode in defending it, or ſome peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of applying it unto the conduct of our lives? A clergy man may either in a pulpit or at an altar have many ſimple wild geſtures, and yet be a ſound Chriſtian for all that. But is ſuch a one to be underſtood here to have an enthuſiaſtick way of religion? He who makes it a part of his religion to defame his innocent neighbours wrongfully, perſuading people that he does God good ſervice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; is this man a fanatick? and yet he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes a very mad way of religion. To ſide firſt with our Engliſh prelacie, and when it is overborn by unlawful violence, to turn unto them who overthrew it; and as ſoon as it is reeſtabliſhed, to come back again to it; is this fanaticiſm? I am ſure it is a mad way of religion. He that diſables his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Biſhops in one book, being a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant himſelf, and in another inveighs heavily againſt ſome Jeſuiſts for reſiſting their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57867:90"/>Biſhops, whom himſelf alſo does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; is this man a fanatick yea or no? And yet he follows and treads a very ſtrange mad way of religion. So that obſcure ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and tropical words are ſo far from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out, that they include rather, and hem in Dr. Still, himſelf, and wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe him in his own circle of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aticiſm. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, his other part, or other whole defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fanaticiſm, <hi>A reſiſting authority under a pretence of religion,</hi> is obſcure enough too. For there be many ſorts of reſiſting, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of authority, and many ſorts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and many religions pretended: and yet not all of them fanatick. All Proteſtants in their firſt reformation reſiſted all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole Catholick world, both ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and civil, and that under pretence of religion, a new way of religion invented by themſelves, oppoſite to the Catholick way, wherein they had all been born and bred: Are all theſe and their ſucceſſors unto this very day fanaticks or no? He will ſay no perhaps, becauſe <hi>they had good reaſon to do it.</hi> But do not Quakers, whom Dr Still. ſpeaks openly to be fanaticks, ſay alſo that they have good reaſon to withſtand and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert our Proteſtant Engliſh Church. <hi>O but no body ſays ſo but themſelves:</hi> Neither did any but thoſe firſt Proteſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts ſay they had any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57867:91"/>reaſon at all: but the whole Catholick world roſe up and condemned them. So that we have got but little light by this definition of his; left wholly in as much obſcurity as ever he was himſelf, after he had been puzling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Schoolmen. Truth is, we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeek into logick or into dictionaties, for the mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing and ſignification of fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or fanaticiſm. For the word, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to religion here in England, is of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary impoſition; never before applied unto any Sects of Chriſtianity, till my Lord General Monk uſed it in Parliament ſome few years ago, to expreſs thoſe men who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of their new invented doctrines contemned and roſe up againſt all authority, and waged war and overthrew both Church and State before them, unto the utter impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhing and deſolation of the Land. Theſe our great General, never to be mentioned in England without honour, called Fanaticks, that is to ſay, mad fooliſh blaſted men, who preferring their own inſtable conceits (for they had now fallen and ſhivered into many Sects) before ſolid obedience unto Church and State, rooted up what ever was fixt for the general good of all men, and contenting themſelves with the pillage of the Land, could ſettle nothing at all themſelves, either of religion or government in the end. Theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57867:91"/>he called Fanaticks. And in his great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he made choice of that new word, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hopes that every one of theſe ſeveral ſects would lay the epither upon his neighbour: as indeed they did. And amongſt theſe men, yea the very chief and ringleaders of them, did Mr. Still. our Doctor joyn himſelf. And yet does he here in his own little ſubtilty lay the whole ignominy now upon the Quakers, as a burthen for the younger brothers to carry. And yet were they hardly born, when the work of fanaticiſm in England was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. By all this we may eaſily diſcern what fanaticiſm means. But yet we muſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding content our ſelves with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition he has given us; ſo far as it can bear any fixt or certain ſenſe; and ſo proceed.</p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>The Church of Rome,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is both ways fanatical, both in an enthuſiaſtick way of religion and reſiſting authority.</hi> A man would wonder how this charge ſhould be made good, of a Catholick Church whoſe religion is ever ſettled, and delivered by tradition from generation to generation, ſtill one and the ſame; and has no other ſuperior Church on earth, either to reſiſt or obſerve. But yet does this man go nimbly about his work, without either fear or ſcruple. <hi>For, firſt, revelations have been countenanced in that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57867:92"/>Church. One of an Abbat in a ſtorm, another of St. Norbert. of St. Gertrude, of St Briget, St. Joan, St. Catherin of Sena, about the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and theſe revelations were contradictory to one another, one affirming the immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the other denying it.</hi> Oho is this the firſt proof of fanaticiſm in the Church! A very pretty one ſurely. He has already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his own definition of fanaticiſm. For here is no mention made either of any new way of religion invented, or of reſiſting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under pretence of it. But all that he eſteems whimſical or fanciful ſtuff, muſt it ſeems be called fanatical. But can any vain fancies, dreams or viſions of two or three, who profeſs a religion, prove that religion to be fanatical? Yes, will he ſay, <hi>if they be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced.</hi> But, firſt, they might be counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, and yet not as any part of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Secondly, how does he prove they were countenanced? becauſe ſome Doctors maintained one of thoſe contradictory reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ſome the other; till the whole buſineſs was ſilenced. Thus he tells his ſtory. But is this to countenance any thing? I think not, nor yet can any one in reaſon think it. It is moreover certainly believed by all Catholicks in the world, that the bleſſed Virgin Mother of our Lord Jeſus, was ever moſt pleaſing to God, and immaculate in all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57867:92"/>her ways, even from her firſt Beeing; and this is not queſtioned by any. The diſpute in Schools yet undecided, is only about the Moode &amp; Tenſe of it; whether that her Sanctity were in her from the beginning, by way of preſervation from the blemiſh of ſin, for every conceivable Inſtant of her being, in her paſſive Conception, as <hi>Scotus</hi> teaches in his School? or whether it were by way of Sanctification, after the firſt real inſtant of her Beeing, wherein, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> by natural progation, ſhe was lyable to Original ſin, as the followers of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> affirm? And this was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thoſe their Revelations or Dreams, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pious opinion <hi>They</hi> conceived of our Lady's purity, <hi>Theſe</hi> of their Angelical Doctors contemplations. But how does this prove, that our general Faith, wherein they all lived and dyed, is Enthuſiaſtick? There be Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in <hi>England,</hi> good ſtore; and thoſe that dream waking too; and yet may not the Church of <hi>England</hi> be called Fanatick for that. Fond contradictory fancies of ſome, make not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Religion, unto whoſe guidance they are to ſubmit, when they come to be queſtioned, any ways in fault. Indeed, the Doctors of theſe Schools, as they have been too earneſt in the maintaining their School. Curioſities, to the admiration of innocent Believers, not at all concern'd in their ſubtilities: So were ſome

It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſuch as are meer School-men, to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their School-<hi>dictates</hi> oft to the prejudice of grace and charity. That <hi>theſe</hi> women ſhould pretend Revelations about a School point, was either the ſtrength of their own fancy, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the way they had heard, or the weakneſs of their guides; It matters not whether, for Saints are not Saints in every point of their lives; fleſh and blood will ſprout Imbecilities, until their perfection comes; And how hard it is to diſcern the Original of Viſions, which of them is divine, which humane, and perhaps an evil Motion, we have examples enough in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, amongſt the Prophets and Sons of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. When <hi>Joſaphat</hi> and <hi>Achal,</hi> Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were to make War on <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> all the chief Prophets were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even four hundred of them, to give their Counſel; All of theſe pretended revelations from God, and yet ſpeak contrary things, eſpecially <hi>Micheas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Zedechias</hi> were at open defiance one with another, about the truth of their Viſions. And yet all this made not any proof that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was Fanatick. But he that wil
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57867:94"/>read more of theſe theological ſubtilties, may ſee it, if he pleaſe, in the works of that learned Divine <hi>Franciſcus à Sancta Clara</hi> a Catholick Doctor; eſpecially in his book <hi>De Schiſmate,</hi> his other called <hi>Paralipomena philoſophica,</hi> and a third called <hi>Religio Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi,</hi> in a more ample and ſolid manner there diſcuſt. I have now ſaid enough of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ſomething more may chance to add by and by, when occaſion offers.</p>
            <p>§. 4. <hi>Saint Catherin had her five ſhining wounds in her bands, feet and ſide: inſenſible of all pains in her extaſies, and could ſmell ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vitious ſouls, as St. Philip Nerius did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; which is one degree above the enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm of a Quaker.</hi> I know not, how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it is above the enthuſiaſm of a Quaker; ſure I am it is far below the fanaticiſm of Doctor Stillingfleet, who talks at this wild rate. What is all this, if it were true, to the definition of fanaticiſm? and where does the fanaticiſm lie? is not this man ſtrangely frantick himſelf, who cannot diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween peoples religion, and the acciden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> that do befall them. Were theſe wounds and Noſes any part of their Creed? Although the Doctor have no ſuch noſe, yet may he have ſuch a ſtink; and though he want the wounds, he may have fairy nips, that are as bad. If
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57867:95"/>St. Catherin were ſo eſtranged from ſenſual things, and ſo abſorpt in God, as is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, God be thanked for it: if ſhe was not, I can believe in God nevertheleſs; and my religion is ſtill the ſame. I did once read a ſtory of a young man in Hungary, who fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for fear, at the coming in of the Turks, into the adjoining woods, lived there ſo long eſtranged from all human diet, that all his friends and neighbours after the Turks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture could not take him; till he chanced to ſlip into a deep pitfall ſet on purpoſe to catch him: The reaſon was, as he afterward related, becauſe his ſmell became ſo refined and pure by his living in the woods on the wild and thin proviſion there, that he ſmelt men a mile or two off, before they could come near him. And this ſtory I judg to be true, as well as that of St Catherin, who had heavenly helps beſide. And if Doſtor Still. unacquainted with ſuch things, eſteem them whimſical, let him think ſo. What them? I do not. It is but the various judgment of two petty Doctors. My religion however is ſtill the ſame ſolid faith it was: unleſs the pain I have now actually in my ſide, muſt give the Church of God a pleuriſie.</p>
            <p>§. 5. <hi>Viſions and apparitions have been made uſe of by them; to prove Doctrines that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57867:95"/>as thoſe related by S. Gregory and S. Bede to prove purgatory; appearances of a child to prove tranſubſtantiation; of a black man blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſins out of a book, when a thief did pennance, to prove confeſsion.</hi> Very good. Then were not thoſe parcels of faith brought in by thoſe viſions. And a whimſical proof by any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, to declare and juſtifie his text, does not infer that divine text to be therefore En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. He told us before, like a Doctor, that fanaticiſm was ſome new enthuſiaſtick way of Religion, or reſiſting authority under pretence of it. Where is all this here? Is fanaticiſm now ſome other thing? nothing but a weak proof? whether Dr. Still. himſelf hath ever uſed in his Sermons any ſuch proof as this is, when he hath diſcourſed of the ſouls ſuperviving after this life ended, I cannot tell. But <hi>I</hi> am confident that if he hath, he did not therefore think himſelf a fanatick; nor yet any others who heard him ſpeak it. I ſhould, if he had either reaſon or appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any thing he utters in this Book of his, think the better both of him and it. The beſt is, that all theſe apparitions here rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were firſt written by venerable and grave men, whoſe words are of greater authority than Stillingfleet-deriſions.</p>

            <p>§ 6. <hi>They not onely prove Doctrines, bus even define things meerly by private revelations.</hi> Do they ſo? What are theſe <hi>things</hi> ſo defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? What is the reaſon he changes his phraſe, and ſays not, as we might have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted he ſhould, that they not onely prove <hi>doctrines</hi> that were before, but define <hi>doctrines</hi> alſo, upon private revelations. He is wary in this, and calls them <hi>things,</hi> not <hi>doctrines.</hi> But yet hopes ſtill that his Reader will ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, as if they defined doctrines as well as proved them upon private revelations. He has a multitude of theſe little tricks; which I muſt let paſs. But what <hi>things</hi> do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine? Let us hear them. <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban the fourth determined the feſtival of corpus Chriſti day, upon a revelation made to ſome Nuns in Leeds. Pope Boniface the feaſt of the archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel Michael upon another made to the Biſhop of Siponto. And why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhould we be told of fanaticiſm ſo often? Do we found our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon any ſuch viſions?</hi> Here we have now the <hi>things</hi> defined upon private revelations; onely a couple of holy days; or rather one holy day; and one Church built upon a hill; and neither of them upon private revelations. The appearance of an Angel, which cauſed the building of the Church, was ſolemn and publick. But corpus Chriſti day was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57867:96"/>apart, or rather transferred from Maunday thurſday in holy week, untill the Paſchal feſtival were ended; becauſe in the holy week, other affairs of piety towards the paſſion of our Lord, unknown to Dr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet, do ſo take up all that time, that people cannot then ſufficiently celebrate the inſtitution of the Euchariſt, as they would and ought to do. This is the known reaſon why <hi>corpus Chriſti</hi> day was inſtituted to be kept apart, the thurſday after Trinity. And if ſome Nuns had any viſion that ſo it ought to be, what then? It onely follows hence, that the viſion they had proved true: and not that any part of Catholick religion was built upon ſuch viſions. For all the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or faith that is in this buſineſs, was before that inſtitution of the holy day. A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time or place for the exerciſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though it be defined, is not to define religion it ſelf. The real preſence or corpus Chriſti was believed and loved and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced long before Pope Urban; and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God honoured before Pope Boniface was born. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith Mr. Still. <hi>ſhould we hear ſo often of fanaticiſm? Do we found our religion upon any ſuch viſions.</hi> And who, gentle Doctor, does found any relgion upon them? Do you call the building of a Church or inſtitution of a holy day, a founding of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57867:97"/>religion. And who tells you ſo often of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm? You caſt it indeed upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here in England, Presbyterians, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and other ſuch like: I know no body elſe who tell you of it. But if you will have me ſpeak what I now think; all the whole proteſtant reformation is fanaticiſm to me, even in the moſt rigorous and ſtricteſt ſenſe.</p>
            <p>§ 7. <hi>Their religious orders, even the chief among them, Benedictins, Carthuſians, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Franciſcans and Jeſuits were all inſtituted by enthuſiaſtick perſons, upon the credit of their viſions and revelations: ſo much hath fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm contributed to their ſupport.</hi> Now this man blows upon us a little more nearly than hitherto: and yet he blaſts but his own ſoul thereby.
For firſt the Catholick Church is truly and properly ſupported by Jeſus Chriſt, her founder and divine Maſter. Then, by the innocence, purity and powerfulneſs of her faith. Next to this, by the care and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy of Apoſtles, venerable Biſhops, and holy Prieſts, who made unblameable thereby in themſelves, are induſtrious to teach and exhort, and ſee this holy religion obſerved and put in practiſe by others committed to their charge. And then alſo, by religious people and all thoſe good Chriſtians, who do earneſtly heed thoſe heavenly dictates of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57867:97"/>our Lord, to fulfill them; ſo diſtributing the time of this their ſhort life, that now they practiſe one good thing, and then another, as occaſion offers, till all juſtice be fulfilled; keeping themſelves unſpotted of the world. So that religious people do no otherways ſupport the Church, but by their ſtudious obſervance of her holy laws and counſels: unleſs the venerable Biſhops do call forth ſome virtuous choice men amongſt them for their help. This is moſt certain.Secondly, no leſs certain it is, that the founders of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders were both pious and wiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſeveral ways proved to be ſo, by their miraculous and innocent lives, before their rule was allowed of. Nor were any of them accepted, as this man ſpeaks of, by the credit of their own viſions.Thirdly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Benedictins and others here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were very eminently religious in the Weſt part of the Church: Yet it is not ſo certain that they are the chief of all religious that either are or have been in Church in any place or age. Very eminent were the orders founded by St. Auſtin, that venerable Doctor and Biſhop in Africa; the Monks of St. Martin a Biſhop in France; thoſe of St. Malachy in Ireland; the religious of St. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, of St. Pacomius, of Caſſianus, St. Jerom, and ſeveral others in the Eaſt and South part
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57867:98"/>of the Church. Very eminent without all doubt, were thoſe many religious Societies, whom St. Jerom and others teſtifie to have ſpread themſelves all over Syria, Armenia, Perſia, Ethiopia, Aſia, and all the northern parts, even amongſt the Goths and Dacians, before the fourth age of the Chriſtian Church. Very eminent were the religious inſtitutes which were all over the countrey we now inhabit, in the Britons time, long before our forefathers the Saxons came in upon them, under the rule of St. Columba, the rule of St. Brendan, the rule of St. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbanus, the rule of St. David, the rule of St. Martin, the rule of St. Auſtin, the rule of St. Patrick, the rule of Lyrinum, the rule of St. Regulus, the rule of St. Ninian, the rule of Floriacum, the rule of St. Joſeph. Very eminent were the epiſcopal Monaſteries, all over the Chriſtian world in primitive times; eſpecially for the firſt ſix hundred years of Chriſtianity, wherein Biſhops themſelves led a monaſtical life with their clergy, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity together. And out of this clergy were ſelected ſtill the choiceſt men for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and learning, to overſee the pariſhes; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they ſtill lived by the ſaid rule, as far as it could be accommodated to their occaſions, unto the edification and comfort of the people. And although our clergy is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57867:98"/>not ordinarily educated now adays in ſo ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct a courſe, yet is it no ways handſom for all that, in my judgment, that theſe men of God, Prieſts of our Lord Jeſus, and venerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſers of his myſteries, ſhould any of them be called Seculars: eſpecially ſith their ſtate and condition requires, that they live in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, under an obedience to their Biſhops, and perhaps without an abſolute dominion of their own goods: and all of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to themſelves ſome good rule or other for the government of their lives. Very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent were the rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gious of 'St Mark in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, where thouſands of them lived more like Angels of God than men. Very eminent were the religious orders inſtituted by the Apoſtles; amongſt whom all things were common, and none had any thing which he could call his own. For they all made a voluntary abdication of their goods, that they might ſerve God uniformly in a community together. Amongſt whom Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias pretending to enter, as diſpropriated of all his goods like the reſt, which indeed he was not; ſuffered a corporal death for his diſſimulation. So that teligious inſtitutes are as antient as Chriſtianity it ſelf. For it is not to be thought that St. Peter and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, would exhort any to a greater perfection of life, than they profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57867:99"/>by their education under Jeſus the great Maſter, whoſe words and counſels muſt ſtill be profeſt by ſome in his Church: while others, whoſe condition of life cannot reach ſo high, conform themſelves to the rules and precepts of ſobriety, juſtice and piety, that are common to all, loving the reſt of their Catholick body, which may ſerve God better than they can do in their worldly entanglements. And I am very clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the true real Church of God, wherein Chriſts good Spirit dwells, as it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has been, ſo never can it be without reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious orders. And it is hard to ſay which of them all from the beginning of the Church to this day is the chiefeſt; or what founder of them was moſt enthuſiaſtical.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>It is a fair way towards the proof of St. Bennets fanaticiſm, as alſo of St. Romwall, St. Bruno, St. Francis and St. Dominick, that Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine confeſſes thoſe orders to be inſtituted by the inſpir ation of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhows himſelf a <hi>Typhaeus</hi> or <hi>terrae filius</hi> indeed. If this be a fair way, I know not what is a foul one. Is the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt the fanaticiſm here ſpoken of? or is one of them a fair way to infer and conclude the other? What a kind of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate talk is this? is the inſpiration of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57867:99"/>Holy Ghoſt and fanaticiſm all one with Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin? or is it all one and the ſame thing with Mr. Stillingfleet? He does not expreſs himſelf here, any further in this buſineſs: but leaves us in our amazement, to think what we pleaſe. But could good St. Bennet ever expect to hear ſuch words ſpoken of him in our iſland of England, ſo much illuſtrated by his children, for ſo many ages together; in which time have reſorted to his Monaſteries millions of pious ſouls, leaving father and mother and all pleaſures, honours, dignities and pride of this weak and ſhort and ſinful life, unto their more ſincere and endleſs bliſs. Muſt St. Romwal and St. Bruno thoſe reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Baptiſts, and fathers of the renowned Camaldulenſians and Chartreux Monks; muſt St. Dominick that patriarch of piety and zeal towards all mens ſalvation; muſt St. Francis full of God, Francis the meek, the poor beadsman and interceſſor for all mankind, in whom Jeſus himſelf our bleſſed Lord ſeemed again to live and breath and bleed afreſh; muſt theſe and ſuch like men, whom former proteſtants themſelves have ſo much hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that in their very heat of controverſie againſt the Church, they have upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſo many ſhining ſtars, as it were ſtopt their career to give them their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, be boldly and without fear now ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57867:100"/>fanaticks, in theſe our laſt and worſe days? what will become of Goſpel? if ſuch words as theſe be not permitted onely, but applauded, farewel all Chriſtianity. But how does this man prove in general, that both themſelves, and their orders were fanatical? becauſe Bellarmin <hi>confeſſes that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Abominable ſtuff! who can hear it? Let us ſee then how he faſtens fanaticiſm to each of them in particular. And we may expect here to find ſome mention of their extreme mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and penitential life, their chaſtity and warching, their patience and abnegation of their wills, their prayer and inceſſant prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, their retiredneſs and ſilence, their humility and punctual obedience, their ſweet and edifying converſation, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found meditation, extaſies and love of God, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous conſummation of their lives at their laſt hour; and other ſuch like graces which tradition and writings have left unto after ages for our encouragement and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</p>
            <p>§ 9. <hi>St. Gregory,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>writes of St. Bennet, that he was a hater of all human lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: that he lived in a cave; that he conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red luſt by rolling himſelf among thorns and net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, that he drove away by the ſign of the Croſs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57867:100"/>a black devil that diſturbed a Monk at his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; that when any Monk did eat out of his ſight he perceived it, that he diſcovered Riggo in a Kings habit to be no King; that he knew the ſecrets of the Divinity; and beheld his ſiſter Scholaſticas ſoul going to heaven.</hi> This is all he ſays of St. Bennet, and he tells it us out of the writings of St. Gregory, one of the beſt and learnedeſt prelates that have ever ſate in St. Peters Chair. But what St. Gregory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers in a ſober grave diſcourſe, he ſpeaks in a mock phraſe, and brings no more of his life unto light, than what himſelf can laugh at. But firſt, this is not the hundredth part of St. Bennets life. Secondly, all this put together infers not fanaticiſm, which is the buſineſs we look after. For here is no reſiſting au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under a pretence of a new way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Religion of St. Bennet was our Catholick religion, the precepts and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, hopes and promiſes of Gods holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, wherein he lived himſelf and bred up all his followers, inviolably. I think Dr. Still. notwithſtanding his own definition, which he does not himſelf heed, calls all thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, who do not, as he does; or do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe that, which he cannot; or have had thoſe gifts from God, which he has not. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, how ſhould living in a cave, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luſt by nettles, a power over devils, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57867:101"/>ſpirit of diſcerning at a diſtance, knowledg of Gods divine myſteries, and the like, ſeem to him any properties of a fanatick. All this if it be true, makes for St. Bennets glory; and no part of it to his diſparagement. His retirement into rocks and caves, his mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of luſt, and all the reſt are good and glorious. And he hath no leſs a man than St. Paul the great Apoſtle, a companion with him alſo in his diſlike of human learning; who both vilifies it, and gives us as great a caution againſt it, as ever St. Bennet did: the ſame bleſſed Apoſtle, as duſty and dirty in his travels, and careleſs of his outward man, as ever St Bennet could be; however taken, as Dr. Still. here tells us, by countrey people for a beaſt. But let the beaſt be where it will. God ſees not as man ſees. And what is comely in our eyes, is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that holy one who regards the heart. Saint Bennet is content with his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Apoſtles and Prophets, who did the ſame things with him, and had the like gifts; and heeds little any deriſion of Stillingfleets long finger.</p>
            <p>§. 10. <hi>Petrus Damianus reports of St. Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal, that he was hard to learn in his youth, that he took ugly birds to be devils and chaced them away; that he was converted by a viſion of St.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57867:101"/>Apollinaris, that he had devils lying upon his legs, and ſometimes bruiſing him in his prayers, that he wept bitterly, when he ſaid Maſs; ſaw Monks going up to Heaven on a Ladder of light: And that St. Bruno and Hugo built the grand Chartreus upon a viſion.</hi> This is all he can pick out againſt St. Romwall and St. Bruno, to prove them fanaticks; that is to ſay mad men: for I cannot tell what elſe he ſhould mean. Nor can any one perceive by his phraſe of ſpeech, whether he relates theſe few things of them (or thoſe of St. Bennet) as things he believes to be true, or which he thinks to be falſe. If falſe, then Peter Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Writer of their Lives is the fanatick, and not St. Bruno or Romwall: If true, then Dr. Still. is the fanatick, and not Peter Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian. For what blame is it in any, either to be hard to learn in youth, or to ſee devils if he did ſee them, or to be converted by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or to weep at Maſs, or the like: where lyes the fanaticiſm of this buſineſs? Here is no news of any new religion invented, or any reſiſting Authority under pretence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He that walks all his whole life in the ways of Chriſtian piety, may have ſuch things as theſe happen to him, partly in his youth, and partly in his maturer age. None of theſe things are unuſual or impoſſible, where Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity odious to evil Angels is practiſed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57867:102"/>and profeſſed in earneſt. The Religion of theſe men is the ſame one Catholick Faith, that is common to all; though all do not keep ſo ſtrict rules to obſerve it, as they did; nor are all block heads, or hard to learn in their youth; nor have all men devils lying upon their legs, or bruiſing them in their prayers; nor do all weep at Maſs, or ſee Ladders of light, or the like. And whether theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and apparitions in any one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick young or old, be true or falſe, imaginary or real, this cannot make his religion either better or worſe; however the man may be otherwiſe affected, then others of the ſame religion, who are free. If Dr. Still. could but ſee the daily lives of the Camaldulenſian Monks or Carthuſians, from their firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders time, in profound ſilence, auſterity and prayers, he would find there is ſome other thing there to do, then to ſcare Crows.</p>
            <p>§ 11. <hi>St. Francis &amp; St. Dominick were the perſons, whom Pope Innocent the third ſaw in a viſion, to ſupport the Lateran Church; hence therefore called the two Lamps,</hi> &amp;c. Surely theſe two men will prove no fanaticks, but grave ſolid Orthodox Chriſtians. For fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks pull down Churches but ſupport none. And yet our Doctour will not have it ſo. They muſt by all means be fanaticks too;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57867:102"/>nay, the chiefeſt of fanatick and enthuſiaſtick men. <hi>For Cardinal Vitriaco,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>calls St. Francis an illiterate man; and St. Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aventure deſcribes him no otherwiſe. His firſt converſion to that ſtrict courſe of life was by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wherein he was ſwallowed up in God: as St. Bonaventure will have it, and his ſoul melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſight of the Crucifix. So tender heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was he to the poor, that ſometimes be rent off his cloaths, to give them, and ſometimes unript and divided them amongſt them: in all this having no teacher but Chriſt, whoſe voice when he heard from a Crucifix he was beſides himſelf, ſo that people flockt about him as a mad man, and caſt dirt at him; and his own father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him before the Biſhop; upon which St. Francis rejoyced now, that he could better ſay Our Father which art in Heaven. In this height of fanaticiſme he made crucifixes in mortar, and preaching to the people pierced their hearts. Then opening the Goſpel thrice, he took the firſt three Sentences for the rule of his Order. He had many extaſies and raptures; and in one of them had a full aſſurance of his ſins remitted. His rule confirmed afterwards by the Pope, he called the book of life and marrow of Goſpel. St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick comes not much behind him. For he had a viſion alſo that God had choſe him and St. Francis, to reform the world and the evil man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men.</hi> This is what he can cull out of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57867:103"/>St. Francis and St. Dominicks life, to prove them both fanaticks and enthuſiaſtick men. And he interlards his narration with much jeſting girds of his own, to make it have the more fanatick relliſh: but all in vain. For though he omit here in a manner all the whole life of thoſe holy and bleſſed men, as he did before in others; and picks out thence onely ſuch few paſſages, as he thought he could laſh, as he went, with the Scorpions of his bold deriſion: yet will not this ſerve his turn. For all that is here reported of St. Francis (the ſcurrillous manner of his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on excepted) is onely his voluntary poverty, his neglect of humane learning and worldly wealth, his divine viſions and entertainments with God, his charity to the poor, his effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preaching unto the reformation of evil manners, his rule of life drawn out of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and confirmed by the chief Chriſtian Prelate: All which things are ſo far from fanaticiſm, that they are quite oppoſite to it. Here is no news of any new invented en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick way of Religion, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a tenour and rule of life drawn out of Goſpel, and confirmed by his own Prelate and Eccleſiaſtical Superiour. The ways of fanaticks &amp; fanaticiſm are quite contrary to this. Much leſs have we here any reſiſtance of Authority, but a ſubmiſſion to Authority
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57867:103"/>and an humble expectation of their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and licence. He muſt ſurely think our Kingdom of England to be much alienated from the Kingdom of God, if he hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that love of poverty, neglect of worldly wealth and humane literature, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the poor, divine revelations, powerful preaching againſt ſin, melting affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and a rule of life drawn out of Goſpel is fanaticiſme. He will be a very dull reader, who will not hence conclude, that our twelve Apoſtles were the firſt and chiefeſt fanaticks in the world. And this our wits too much prone to looſneſs and atheiſm will greedily enough, and nimbly infer: and perhaps rejoyce that they have an Atheiſt in Print, to propagate their infidelity. Atheiſm loves not lonelines; but is then moſt ſecure when the company is greateſt.</p>
            <p>But it will be here objected, why then did St. Bennet, St. Francis, and St. Dominick make themſelves new rules? Is not this a new religion? Sir, although a Catholick cannot eaſily be ſo ignorant, as to ask any ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion as this is; yet becauſe it may be the ſtraw, at which Dr. Still. ſtumbles, who as in this his whole book he ſpeaks like a Child, ſo, for ought I know, he may underſtand like a Child; I ſay therefore, that a new rule is ſo far from a new religion, that the Goſpel
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57867:104"/>can do little good without it: For the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and precepts of Goſpel, whereby our ſouls are to be ſanctified, and ordered to our final end, are all general and abſtracted from any circumſtance of time, or place, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or manner; to the end, they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to the many conditions, profeſſions, and imployments of mankind, in their ſeveral ſtates and ages. Watching, faſting, works of charity, mortification of ſenſuality, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the various like good things, commended to us in our holy Goſpel, are ſo preſcribed and counſelled us, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the when, the where, how often, how long, and other ſuch like circumſtances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which thoſe rules and counſels cannot be brought down to execution and pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ck Church brought down ſome of theſe things unto individual circumſtances, when ſhe appointed rites and times for Sacraments, ſet holy days for people to meet together in their meditations and prayers, ſet times for faſts, others for confeſſion, others for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſome for rejoycing in our Lord, ſome for mourning and doing pennance, ſo much and in ſuch a manner, as might well conſiſt with the generality of the Catholick world. But becauſe neither is this ſufficient
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57867:104"/>for our daily progreſs, unleſs people, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their own particular occaſions, and the lettanees which may occur more in one hour of the day then another, ether ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a further rule, for their daily piety and particular ordering of their houſes, or follow the direction herein of ſome wiſer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man: Hence it is that ſo many rules have iſſued forth in the Chriſtian world; by which ſome people have governed their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes, accommodating them in the beſt wiſe they could unto their affairs; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have quite retired out of the world, to ſerve God more perfectly all their life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this or that approved rule, in a more full obſervance of it under Monaſtical obedience. This is the motive nature and end, of ſo many rules in the Church of God; whereof ſome ſuit beſt with one complexion, and ſome with another. And all of them tend unto the bringing down of Goſpel unto a conſtant practice. And what Chriſtian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſets himſelf no ſuch rule, nor follows any, muſt needs live a looſe and careleſs if not a wicked life, although he ſhould have the whole Goſpel by heart, and be able to ſpeak it all without book.</p>
            <p>If the exact lives and pious rules of St. Bennet, St. Francis, St. Dominick, St. Baſil, St. Brun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will only ſet down here the one rule of St. Francis, according to which his religious diſciples are regulated all their life time throughout the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by either your ſelf, Sir, or any other may judge whether he be worthily called either fool or fanatick.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>St. Francis his Rule.</head>
               <p>Chap. 1. THe rule and life of Fryar mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours is this; To obſerve the holy Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; living in obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out property of goods, and in chaſtity. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Francis doth promiſe obedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto Biſhop Honorius his Lord, and to his Succeſſors Canonically inſtalled, and to the Roman Church. And be other Fryars bound to obey Brother Francis and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
               <p>Ch. 2. If any ſhall be willing to take this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57867:105"/>life, and ſhall therefore preſent themſelves to our Brothers, let them be ſent to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Miniſters, who may only, and none beſides them, have power to admit them. The Miniſters muſt be diligent to examine them about Catholick Religion and Church Sacraments. And if they believe theſe things, and will faithfully confeſs them, and firmly obſerve them to the end, and either have no Wives, or thoſe Wives if any they have, are entered into Monaſteries, or by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe are diſmiſt, a vow of continence now ſolemnly made, and their ſaid Wives be of that age, that there can ariſe no ſuſpicion of them: let the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters then ſpeak unto them the word of holy Goſpel, that they go and ſell all their goods, and beſtow them upon the Poor. Which thing if they cannot be able to do, their good will in this part may ſuffice: And let the Brothers beware, and their Miniſters too; that they be not ſolicitous about the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods of theſe men: that they may freely diſpoſe thoſe things of their own as our Lord ſhall inſpire them. And if Counſel be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Miniſters have leave to ſend them unto ſome men fearing God, by whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they may beſtow their goods upon the Poor. After this they may grant them their veſt of probation; namely two tunicks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57867:106"/>a capuce, and a girdle and drawers, and a caparoon down to the girdle; unleſs the Miniſters ſhall otherwiſe think fit according to God. After the year of probation is ended, let them be received unto obedience, promiſing ever to obſerve this life and rule. And in no wiſe ſhall it be lawful for them to go out of this religion, according to the command of my Lord our chief Biſhop: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to Goſpel, no man putting his hand unto the Plough, if he look back is fit for the Kingdom of God. And thoſe who now have promiſed obedience, let them have one tunick with a capuce, and another without a capuce, ſuch as will have it. And thoſe who are urged by neceſſity may wear ſhooes. But let all our Fryars be cloathed with courſe Garments, and they may mend them with Sack-cloath, or other pieces on Gods bleſſing. All whom I do exhort and admoniſh, that they neither deſpiſe nor judge men, whom they ſhall ſee cloathed in ſoft and coloured raiments, to uſe finer meats and drinks, but let every one of them judge and deſpiſe himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ch. 3. The Clarks muſt ſay the divine Office according to the courſe of Roman Church, the Pſalter onely excepted, out of which they may have Breviaries. But Laimen are to ſay four and twenty times, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

But as for the holy Lent, which begins from Epiphany unto fourty days after it, which our Lord by his own holy faſt hath conſecrated, thoſe who voluntarily will faſt it, Gods bleſſing be upon them: and they who will not, let them not be tied to it. But the other Lent, from Aſhwedneſday un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eaſter day, let them all faſt that. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, excepting Fryday, they need not faſt. And in times of manifeſt neceſſity, let no brother be tied to corporal faſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng. And I counſel admoniſh and exhort my brothers in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that when they chance to walk through the world, they do not wrangle nor contend with words, nor cenſure other men; but be meek, peaceable, modeſt, gentle and humble, civilly ſpeaking unto all men, as becomes them. And they ought not to ride, but in a manifeſt neceſſity and urgent weakneſs. In what ever houſe they enter, let them firſt ſay, Peace to this houſe: and let them according to holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel eat what is ſet before them.</p>
               <p>Ch. 4. I do firmly command all my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that in no wiſe they receive Money or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57867:107"/>Coin, either by themſelves immediately, or by another perſon interpoſed. And for the neceſſities of the ſick, or the cloathing of brothers, the Miniſters only and the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers may by their Spiritual friends take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care, according to places and times and coldneſs of countries, as they ſhall find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for their need: this ſtill provided, that as it is already ſaid, they receive no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney nor coin.</p>
               <p>Ch. 5. Thoſe brothers whom our Lord hath given the gift and ſtrength to work, let them labour faithfully and devoutly; yet ſo, that idleneſs our ſouls enemy being kept out, they extinguiſh not the ſpirit of holy prayer and devotion, unto which all other tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things ought to be ſtill ſubſervient. And for reward of their work, they may take the neceſſaries of body, both for themſelves and brothers, beſides coin or money, and that humbly, as becomes the ſervants of God, and followers of moſt holy poverty.</p>
               <p>Ch. 6. Our brothers may appropriate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to themſelves, not houſe, not place, not any thing, but as ſtrangers and pilgrims in this world, in poverty and humility ſerving our Lord; let them confidently go for Alms. Nor muſt they be aſhamed, for our Lord for us hath made himſelf poor in this world. This, this is the high towring ſpire of our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57867:107"/>ſublime poverty; which hath inſtalled you my deareſt brothers, heirs and Kings of that Kingdom of the Heavens. It hath made you poor in pelf; but in vertues it hath raiſed you up on high. Let this be your portion, even this poverty which will conduct you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of the living, unto which my deareſt brothers remaining cloſe and wholly fixt, no other thing for the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may you wiſh to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven for ever. And where ever my brothers are, or meet with one another, let them ſhow themſelves towards one another as domeſticks: and let each one open to the other his neceſſity freely. For if a mother nouriſhes and careſſes her carnal child: how much more carefully ought each one to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and love his ſpiritual brother. And if any of them fall into ſickneſs, other brothers ought to ſerve him, as they would be ſerved themſelves.</p>
               <p>Ch. 7. If any of our brothers by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Satan ſhall ſin unto death, for ſuch ſins as it has been appointed among our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that recourſe ſhould be had only to our Provintial Miniſters, let the ſaid brother be bound to have recourſe unto them, as ſoon as poſſibly he may, without delay. And the ſaid Miniſters if they be Prieſts muſt enjoyn him a pennance with mercy: if they be not Prieſts,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57867:108"/>let them cauſe it to be enjoyned by other Prieſts of the Order, as they ſhall according to God think fitteſt; and they muſt take heed they fall not into wrath, and trouble for the ſin of another; for anger and diſturbance in ones ſelf and others hinder charity.</p>
               <p>Ch. 8. All our Fryars univerſally muſt ſtill have one of the brothers of this religion for the Miniſter general, and ſervant of the whole brotherhood: and him they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obey; and when he goes out of office, an election of a ſucceſſor muſt be made by the Provincial Miniſters and Controllors, in the Pentecoſt Chapter; wherein the Provincial miniſters are bound to meet, where ever it is by the miniſter general appointed: and this once in three years, or in ſome other term of time either greater or leſſer, as by the ſaid Miniſter it ſhall be ordained. And if at any time it ſhould appear to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the miniſters Provincial and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers, that the ſaid general elect is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the ſervice and common good of the brothers, the ſaid brothers, unto whom the election does belong, may in the name of our Lord chooſe themſelves another for a cuſtos; and after the Pentecoſt Chapter, the Miniſter and Controllors may all, if they pleaſe, and it ſeem good unto them, in the ſame year convocate their brothers unto a Chapter in their cuſtodies.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57867:108"/>
               <p>Ch. 9. Let not our brothers preach in the Dioceſs of any Biſhop, where it is forbidden them by him. And let no brother preſume at all to preach unto people unleſs he be firſt examined and approved by the Miniſter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of this Fraternity, and have by him that office of preaching deputed to him. I do alſo admoniſh and exhort all our brothers, that in any preachings they make, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions be well examined and chaſt, unto the profit and edification of people, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to them vice and vertue, puniſhment and glory, with brevity of ſpeech, for an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated word hath our Lord made upon earth.</p>
               <p>Ch. 10. Thoſe brothers, who are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and ſervants of their other brothers, muſt viſite and admoniſh their other bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and charitably reprove them; not commanding them any thing, that may be contrary to their own ſoul and our rule; and the brothers who are ſubjects, muſt remember that for God they have denied their own wills; and therefore do I ſtrongly command them that they do obey their Miniſters in all things, which they have promiſed our Lord to obſerve, and are not contrary to their own ſoul and our rule. And where ever our brothers be, who ſhall perceive and know, that they are not able to obſerve the rule
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57867:109"/>punctually; unto their Miniſters ought they and may they have recourſe, and the Miniſters muſt charitably and chearfully receive them, and ſhow ſo great familiarity towards them, that they may ſpeak to them, and act as Maiſters to their ſervants; for ſo it ought to be, that miniſters be the ſervants of all the brothers. And now I admoniſh and exhort in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that our brothers beware of all pride, vain glory, envy, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, care and ſolicitude of this world, &amp; of detraction alſo and murmuring. And let not the illiterate care to learn letters, but let them heed, what they ought to deſire above all things, to have the ſpirit of our Lord and his holy operation in them, to pray always unto God with a pure heart, and to have hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and patience in perſecutions and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to love thoſe who perſecute us, for our Lord ſaith, Love your enemies, pray for ſuch as perſecute and ſlander you; bleſſed are they who ſuffer perſecution for juſtice: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, and he who perſevers to the end ſhall be ſafe.</p>
               <p>Ch. 11. I do ſtrongly command all our brothers, that they keep no ſuſpicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or talk with women: and that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into the Monaſteries of Nuns, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting onely ſuch unto whom a ſpecial li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is allowed by the See Apoſtolick: nor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57867:109"/>that they be Godfathers to men or women, leaſt by this occaſion any ſcandal ariſe, either of the brothers or amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Ch. 12. What brother ſoever by Gods inſpiration ſhall have a will to go amongſt the Sarazens and other infidels, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand licence of his Miniſter Provincial. And let not the Miniſters give licence to any, but ſuch as they ſhall ſee fit to be ſent. Moreover I do enjoyn the Miniſters by obedience, that they ask of my Lord our Pape, a Cardinal of the Roman Church who may be governour, protectour and correctour of the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: that always ſubject to the feet of the ſame holy Roman Church, we may ſtable in Catholick faith, obſerve poverty, humility, and the holy Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which we have firmly promiſed.</p>
               <p>This is the rule of St. Francis, and his gray Fryars, wherein are apparently all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect lineaments of a good ſound Catholick Chriſtian; but of fanaticiſme nothing at all. Nor can I poſſibly tell, why he ſhould aſcribe fanaticiſme to perſons wholly Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, reſigned, humble, meek, ſpiritual men; unleſs perhaps becauſe ſome one viſion or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is written, to have happened to one or other of them in their life. And this may ſeem ſtrange and incredible indeed to carnal men, who do never really and heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57867:110"/>with God: but to others who are as much ſpiritual as they are carnal, it is no ſuch great a novelty; witneſs our holy Apoſtles and Prophets, who had them frequently. I cannot tell whether our Engliſh fanaticks, ſuch I mean as are called ſo, do ever pretend any of theſe viſions; if they do, they are not fanaticks becauſe of their viſions, but becauſe they are pretended only and falſe, and Dr. Still. does neither ſay nor go about to prove that theſe viſions were falſe, or ſo much as that they were frequent and familiar in their life. And if one or other ſuch peculiar vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite from God, either by viſion or revelation may conclude a man to be fanatical, farewel all religion, both Hebrew and Chriſtian; for the ſounders and teachers of both were fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly abſort in God, which Dr. Still. derides here in St. Francis, and viſited by him in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, revelations, and viſions conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Let me, Sir, in this paragraf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you; that when I firſt at your requeſt undertook this work, not much pleaſing to my hand, which uſes a pen with much d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd and thoughts were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly then taken up, with this one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Doctors book, wherein I intended to be moſt copious; not thinking to meet
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57867:110"/>with ſuch a multitude of impertinences and falſehoods, as have now ſtopped me at every turn, I muſt therefore be ſhorter then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and do like Whittingtons cat, which ſet down in a houſe ſwarming with mice and rats, could do no more then cruſh the heads now of one, and then of another, all day long, for want of leiſure to eat up any. Some things I thought to ſay of theſe religious founders; and ſome of the orders founded by them. Concerning the founders, I meant firſt to ſet down the miraculous lives of theſe Saints, their profound humility, patience, continence, and poverty, their contempt of this vain tranſitory world, conſiſting not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding with a moſt cordial affection, reſpect and love, which they bore to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, their continual converſe with the God of ſpirits; their ſtrange joy in contumelies and other injuries, which is a perfection very few can arrive unto in this life; their carneſt aſpirations after the fight of Jeſus and his Heavenly Kingdom; with their glorious triumph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng death. Of all which we have as clear and certain tradition, as if they had lived but yeſterday. And Dr. Still. hath been picking, as it ſeems, amongſt thoſe fragrant relicks, not with any ſpirit of a Chriſtian, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to love or imitate them; but to fill up, like an adder, the venom of his own breaſt,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57867:111"/>and then to diſgorge himſelf into a book.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I had it then in my heart, to diſcover at large the various growth of Saints; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uniformly anſwerable to one another, nor yet to themſelves in the ſeveral ages of their life: and yet all of them friends of God, and acceptable to him in the courſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of their lives. Nor is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that men incompaſſed with the like infirmities we be our ſelves, ſhould in all the parts either of their whole life, or any one year or month therein be ſtill alike, either devout, or joyous, or indiſturbed. What is born of fleſh is fleſh, inclining to ſenſual things, and unwilling to be reſtrained, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to cold, hunger, and ſeveral infirmities; and therefore averſt from kneeling, faſting, contemplation, eſpecially if it be long and frequent, and ſtill leaning towards its own delight and ſatisfaction. On the other ſide, what is born of ſpirit, is ſpirit; ſtill flying upwards towards the God of ſpirits, in whom is moſt permanent and ſolid bliſſe. And theſe two muſt be allowed ſometimes in us, to ſtruggle and get the maſtery, at leaſt to come to ſuch equitable conditions, that the ballance may hang ſtraight. No man is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly made naught: neither is holineſs the work of a day; there appears in Corn firſt a ſlender green ſprig like graſs, then a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57867:111"/>blade, then an ear promiſing grain, which comes up at length, if it be helped and not hurt, cheriſhed by ſweet ſhowers and the the Suns vital warmth, and not blaſted with mildew, nor lodged by winds, nor trod down by beaſts. And what is good Corn in the fields, the ſame thing are Saints in the Church: though not one of a thouſand of them is put in the Calender. When any one of them is a child, he ſpeaks like a child, and thinks like a child, and does like a child; and his main perfection then, is obedience, fear and obſervance of his parents, who if they be careful of their children after baptiſm, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians were, might ſet them in the right way of a bleſſed life without much trouble. In their youth, they have various properties; ſome blameable, and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, ſome imitable, and ſome to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. St. Auſtin was perverſe in his ways, St. Francis gallant in his converſation, St. Lawrence charitable, St. Bennet pious, St. Romwall fearful, St. Bruno penſative, St. Do. minick rigorous, St. Martin devout, St. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory ſtudious, St. Nicholas addicted to abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, St. Hilary bent againſt hereſies, St. Anthony inclined to deſarts, St. Thomas to reading, St. Vincent to preaching and the like, with infinite variety. And all of them by light of Goſpel, and rule of life drawn out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57867:112"/>thence, and accommodated to their occaſions, went on ſtill mending, pruning and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting themſelves, for Gods favour and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſence, even in their mortal bodies as a Temple upon earth, proceeding ſtill from vertue to vertue, till they all met united at length, in one contemplation, one ſpirit, one peace and joy in God for eyer. And he who thus perſevers unto the end is ſafe; and no ſaint, till his voyage be wholly ended. Nor is any imperfection in their life, to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto other original, then their earthly tabernacles, as all ours are. Some of them alſo, which I muſt not here omit to ſpeak are fanciful, fearful and ſcrupulous; as probably was St. Romwall in his youth, and very many good women, amongſt whom I may well reckon St. Bridget, Gertrude, Joan of the Croſs, and Catherine of Sena, not as if their whole life were ſo, but becauſe they were once in their life taken notice of, for a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble working of their imagination, about the conception. Thoſe religious women that were governed by Franciſcans, fancied Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus his way trueſt, the other a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>minican Nan, ſaw St. Thomas his ſchool was in the right. Whereas indeed they ſaw perhaps nothing at all in it, nor underſtood where the difference lay. And all of them were equally then leſt to themſelves in puniſhment
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57867:112"/>of their buſineſs about affairs, that did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all concern them; it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their own fault ſo much, as thoſe mens, who put theſe impertinent things into their heads, though not perhaps unto any offence to God, yet unto ſome diſturbance, neither uſeful to themſelves nor others. And if thoſe Divines and Doctors, who went about to have the viſions and revelations of the ſaid good women approved, had been truly wiſe, they might have eaſily underſtood, that Gods good Spirit, which inſpires, inlightens and ſtrengthens us in the ways and will of Chriſt our great Lord, never interpoſes in ſubtil curioſities of men.

               <p n="3">3. It was then in my thoughts to ſhow in an ample manner, how all the men renowned for ſanctity in the world, Elias, Eliſha, ſaint John Baptiſt, and all the Prophets, our own twelve Apoſtles and the firſt preachers of Chriſt upon earth, were no others then ſuch men as St. Bennet, Romwall, Bruno, Francis, Dominick, even in thoſe very things, whence Still. concludes them all to be fanaticks and fools. Saint Paul ſaw in a viſion the ſecrets of God, which he could never expreſs by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane words; which thing is derided here in St. Bennet, who is ſaid to have known the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57867:114"/>ſecrets of the Divinity. St. Peter had a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſheet let down from Heaven by the four corners of it: and ſuch a viſion was that of St. Francis and Dominick ſupporting the Lateran Church. St. Paul was buffeted by an Angel of Satan, which is mockt at as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical in ſaint Romwall bruiſed by evil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Saint Peter diſcovered Ananias, that he was not what he pretended, diſpropriated of his goods: which is markt as fanatical in St. Bennet, diſcovering the diſſimulation of Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, who appeared before him as a King, and was not. Saint Paul melted ſo much with the love of Jeſus, that he no more lived now, but Jeſus lived in him; which is laughed at here in ſaint Francis, ſaid to melt away at the fight of the Crucifix. The ſame Apoſtle was abuſed all manner of ways, nay even ſcourged and whipt by the Jews his own country-men; which is noted here as a ſign of fanaticiſm in ſaint Francis, when the people derided, and threw dirt at him. Jacob ſaw a Ladder let down from Heaven: flouted here in ſaint Romwall; who ſaw Monks aſcending upon ſuch a thing. Eliſeus diſcerned the ſecrets contrived in the King of Syria's chamber: which is here vilified in ſaint Bennet, ſaid to perceive his Monks when they drunk or eat out of his ſight. Abraham and Daniel, ſaint John Evangeliſt and others, had frequent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57867:115"/>revelations and viſions of good and bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; the leaſt part whereof is here eſteemed ridiculous in ſaint Romwall and ſaint Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; nay our holy Lord and Saviour tells us many of his own viſions, of Nathanael for example ſeen under his figtree; of Dives and Laz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rus perceived in diſtant places and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; of the Angels falling from Heaven like lightning. And we are here to obſerve, that whatever grace or vertue our Lord had himſelf, ſhould be diſperſed among thoſe who follow him, with a true and upright heart, for of his fulneſs we all receive, even grace for grace. Whence we may well conclude that ſaint Francis, Bennet, Romwall, Bruno, and Dominick, were Jeſus Chriſts true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, by the graces and viſions they had like himſelf; and not that they were fools and fanaticks: except we intend that others, more forward men ſhould by the ſame topick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the like of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: and what I pray you Sir, would a prophane Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick what ſport would it make upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words of the Goſpel concerning our Lord; for example, Marc. 3. where it is ſaid of him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he was beſide himſelf. Is not this in our Doctors engliſh to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick? ſaint Francis with the reſt ſlighted the world left their patrimonies, went poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attired, beaten, reviled, ſcoft at by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57867:115"/>world. Were not all the Apoſtles ſuch men? in a mind piouſly diſpoſed theſe things would ſeem glorious, and tranſcending the power of fleſh and blood, either to do or ſuffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, through our whole life, without ſome ſpecial aſſiſtance from Heaven. But where God once inhabits, he raiſes above earthly things thoſe holy tabernacles of his, now wholly converſant in Heaven. And ſo much indeed as any man hath of God, ſo much is he he like to ſaint Francis and Bennet, to the Prophets and Apoſties of our Lord, however theſe may appear to carnal eys contemptuous and vile. Fleſh and blood left alone ſeeks eaſe, wealth, fulneſs, honour, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is guſtful to our outward ſences or more interiour imagination, reduced into concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of fleſh, concupiſcence of eyes and pride of life. And he that laughs at the lives of St. Bennet or St. Francis, and the reſt like unto them, can have but little of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in him, if any thing at all. The ſtile of the holy Ghoſt concerning ſuch men is Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite unto the jeering phraſe of Dr. Stilling fleet. By faith, ſaith holy Writ, Abraham as ſoon as he was called obeyed, to march forth into a place he ſhould inhabite, not knowing whither he went. By faith he removed towards a land promiſed him, into a ſtrange country, and dwelt in tabernacles,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57867:116"/>and ſo did Iſaac and Jacob heirs with him of the ſame promiſe. For he looked for a City having a foundation, whoſe builder and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is God. Thus ſpeaks the holy Scripture, and is not this St. Bennets caſe as well as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams. Did not he thus march forth out of his father houſe, thus dwell in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of rocks and caves, looking after a City built above in Heaven: and both St. Bennet and Abraham did both of them dye in that their faith, and never returned again from whence they came. Again, by faith, ſaith holy Scripture Moſes, when he was great, refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaos daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer adverſity with the people of God, then to injoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; preferring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes and taunts, before the treaſures of Egypt. Thus did Moſes, and is it not the ſame thing which St. Francis did? St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis preferred rebukes and taunts for Chriſts ſake whom he loved, before the pleaſure of his fathers houſe; nay to ſuffer adverſity with Gods peculiar people for that name, he rejoyced to be diſinherited by his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Moſes then and St. Francis were both of them either wiſe and holy men, or a couple of fools. Holy Scripture goes on thus; others were tortured and racked: others mocked and ſcourged, bound and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57867:116"/>ſtoned and murdered; caſt out from amongſt men and baniſhed; walking up and down in Sheeps skins and Goats skins, in need and want, in tribulation and affliction, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in wilderneſſes, in mountains, dens and caves of the earth: of whom the world was not worthy, and all theſe men through faith obtained a good report. Thus ſpeaks holy Writ; but Dr. Stilling fleet has no good report for them; they are all in his phraſe and judgment, madmen and fanaticks, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the world, whom the holy Ghoſt, judges beloved and divine Heroes, of whom, the world is not worthy. And our great Lord at the ſight of theſe exulted in Spirit and ſaid. I confeſs to thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth; for that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them to babes. So O Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſo ſeemed good before thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another thing alſo did then much run in my thoughts, and it is this, that all the whole Hiſtory of our Lords incarnation paſſion, aſcention, is liable to the ſame kind of deriſion here uſed by this Doctour. Nay the whole Goſpel, and all the precepts and counſels of Chriſtianity, together with all its threats and promiſes, are as meer a folly unto a carnal man, that will preſume <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſport himſelf with them, as any thing here derided.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57867:117"/>Few of thoſe who live in this preſent age are ignorant of this. Our ears are beaten with ſuch talk familiarly in all places. And the bearer does generally but laugh, and applaud the wit of this prophane orator. For this reaſon St. Paul to prevent the cavil, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges himſelf a fool aforehand. Ye do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly bear with fools, ſaith he to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Corinth, and take me, if you pleaſe, for ſuch another. We are all fools in Chriſt. And if any one doth ſeem to be wiſe among you, let him become a fool too, that he may be wiſe indeed. I know, ſaith he again, that the word of the croſs is but folly unto deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate forlorn men. But Gods folly is wiſer than mans wit. The fooliſh things of the world theſe hath God choſen, that he may confound the wiſe: and ſo hath that holy one ordered his ways and counſels, that by folly he might ſave the world, which carnal wiſdom had undone. Theſe and other things to this purpoſe ſpeaks that holy man. And what, I pray you, Sir, is greater folly with carnal men, than to paſs by injuries inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ſuffer our ſelves to be abuſed in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; to divide our goods among poor people, neither of kin to us, nor perhaps known; to diſdain this preſent life; to fly with all caution the delights and pleaſures of it; to pant and breath after our laſt hour;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57867:117"/>ſo to mannage all our affaires, as if our Soul were but a pilgrim in our mortal body, to meditate daily on our latter end; ſtill to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract our mind from viſible and corporeal things ready to fly hence out of this priſon unto our God inviſible, our bodies either ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly regarded or wholly neglected, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps chaſtiſed and curbed; that liveing here we may expreſs our Lords death, and dying obtain part of his reſurrection and glory, which yet our eye never ſaw, nor ear heard, nor can our heart conceive what it is. All this which is but evangelical rules and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, acted by good Catholicks unto each ones ability, and preached and talked of ſomtimes by Proteſtants themſelves, are derided now by witts of this age as folly and madneſs. And if Dr. Still. do well, they muſt do well too</p>
               <p>Fifthly my purpoſe then was to prove, that St. Bennet, St. Francis, and the reſt here derided for fools, were all of them profound judicious men, as any perhaps ever was: and this too, whether they be weighed in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary, wherin for certain they will carry it; or whether they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the great heroes of the world, who wrought ſo many great things both at home and abroad, in war and peace, without read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any books of pedan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57867:118"/>on by thoſe worthies as things far below them. All the books of the world will never make a fool wiſe, nor will a wiſe man want any thing by the loſs of them, beſides a little paſtime. Subſtantial wiſdom is implanted in the ſpirit of man by his firſt Creatour; and this alone in its great latitude of degrees diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns mens excellences. And what comes by reading of books is but like the outward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of a wall, which will never make it ſound, if it be rotten before. The holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell indeed is needfull to the world; becaus it turns the faces of poor miſled mankind from falſe unto true and permanent felicity. But this alſo, if it be uſed only as other books are, to quote places in latin, greek or hebrew, or repeat ſentences without book, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſpute and talk, makes no man truly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wiſer or better any one jot, then he was before. Goſpell ſo far poliſhes, ſo far ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies, ſo far makes us wiſe, ſo far happy, as we put it in practice and no farther. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning, that is philoſophy and langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which is all that can be underſtood by it, this might theſe Saints both neglect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs and diſſwade it alſo with all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto Chriſtians, who looking after a world to come, ought no more in true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to intangle themſelvs in this, then any other vanities of this tranſitory life. And
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57867:118"/>St. Paul himſelf who underſtood true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom well enough, inveighes as ſtrongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as any of theſe above named Saints, calling it a windy puffing buſineſs, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the firſt ruin of mankind, who was therfore carefully forbidden the inſipid tree of knowledg, whoſe fruit fills us up only with wind and ſin. And this old myſtical precept, St. Paul renews in plain words, when he counſels us, to beware of vain, philoſophy, that we be not led away and deceived by it, according to the conſtitutions of men and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of this world; ſuch as is the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of Ariſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, Pithagoras and ſuch like men, now crept god wot into our Chriſtian Schools, and there dominereing unto our much loſs of time, hinderance of devotion, and prejudice of mutual charity. I know they do ſome good unto the ſharpening of our wits, if men could be content with that. But many will not reſt here but even wear out their lives in thoſe empty ſhadows, that have nothing at all in them either of ſolidity or ſubſtance, nor tend to any thing but diſcours. There is other learning for Chriſtians, more ſolid and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, more comfortable and uſeful, more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating our hearts, then all this vain lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, which puffs us up, as if we were ſome great ones, and yet God knows has neither
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57867:119"/>ſavour in it nor ſuſtinence. And that other was the learning and wiſdom of theſe holy men, who knew how to act and ſpeak like Angels of God. And truly ſo much judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had St. Francis the verieſt ſimplician of all the five, that men of thoſe times would rather acquieſce to his opinion in any weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affair or matter of conſcience, then any now either to ſubtil Scotus, or any other of our Schoolmen. His very rule though it ſeem auſtere, is nothing but the very ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Chriſtian prudence. And ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monuments which he left behind him, kept yet amongſt his children, although brief and few, are ſo ſolid and judicious as well as ſweet and pious, that if he were a fool, I know not where to find a wiſe man upon earth amongſt Chriſtians. But it muſt needs add, I think, to his heavenly glory, what made him ſo much exult as yet a mortal on this earth, to be contemned, reviled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly treated here by Dr. Stillingfleet. And ſo let him live with joy in God for ever.</p>
               <p>St. Paul diſtinguiſhes a double ſort of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; one carnal, which is an enemy to God; another ſpiritual, which is at variance with the world. And both of theſe have a vaſt latitude of degrees in ſeveral men. Some are ſo carnal, that they have nothing of Gods
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57867:119"/>ſpirit in them: and ſome again ſo ſpiritual as if they had no body to look after. Theſe are rare, and thoſe frequent in this world. Others again have ſome part of both the one and the other: and this in a vaſt unſpeakable variety. But he that hath nothing of Gods ſpirit here, ſhall never ſee God hereafter. Who ſowes by fleſh, of fleſh ſhall reap cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and he who ſowes in ſpirit, of the ſpirit ſhall reap eternal life. Carnal wiſdom is converſant in carnal things, and ſpiritual wiſdom in things ſpiritual. And according as one walks in ſpirit, ſo he neglects the things of the fleſh; on the other ſide, as he walks in fleſhly deſires, ſo he contemns and vilifies the ſpiritual. For fleſh covets againſt the ſpirit, and ſpirit againſt the fleſh: and theſe two are adverſaries one to the other. The works of the fleſh are adultery, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, uncleanneſs, wanton dalliance, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, witchcraft, enmities, ſcolding, emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wrath, ſedition, ſects, envy, murder, drunkennes, bankettings, and the like. The works of the ſpirit, Charity, joy, peace gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes, bounty, goodnes, faith, meeknes, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and ſuch like. And accordingly we ſee men carnally wiſe, to be crafty, covetous, injurious, leacherous, malitious, envious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, detractours, ſupplanters of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent neighbours, proud, contumelious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heedful
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57867:120"/>of their pacts and promiſes, uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, unmerciful, bold, impious, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Gods Law, and fearleſs of him.

This is the wiſdom of Saints, whom crafty worldly men looking upon as fanaticks and fools make their prey of them, and eat them up as ſheep prepared for their table. So that as this true and ſpiritual wiſdom conforming us to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt receives ſomtimes peculiar viſits and priviledges from God; ſo is it likly to meet with contempt, hunger, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, ſcourges, and perſecutions in this world. And theſe are the things which Dr. Stillingfleet h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re derides in theſe five Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Saints: which be either the genuin works
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57867:120"/>of ſpiritual wiſdom: or ſecondly ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar priviledges conferred from heaven upon it; or thirdly ſome afflictions that do annoy it, either from evil Angels or men. That they fled from their Fathers hous, mortified their fleſh and carnal concupiſcence, retired to rocks and caves, wept at their devotions, neglected human literature; that they were ſwallowed up in God, melted at the ſight of the crucifix, tender hearted towards the poor, covering them ſometimes with their own cloaths, thoſe texts of holy Goſpel for the rule of their life; theſe and ſuch like things are but the connatural operations of divine wiſdom and Gods good ſpirit in them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they perceived angels or drove them away by the ſign of the croſs; that they ſeemed to be beſides themſelves after they had converſed with God in prayer, and unlike unto other men; that they pierced their hearers hearts when they preached and exhorted them; that they diſcerned the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and fraud of people who appeared before them, and ſomtimes the evil deeds and counſels of men out of their ſight; that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine viſions were made either to themſelves, or to other men concerning them and their peculiar friendſhip with God; all ſuch things as theſe are but peculiar priviledges of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven graunted unto ſome ſpecial friends and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57867:121"/>lovers who are wiſe to God. Thirdly, that they were taken for beaſts, derided, ſcoft, pelted with dirt or ſtones, whipt, renounced by their parents, buffeted and bruiſed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Satan, walking in extream hunger and dirty attire, reviled and contumeliouſly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; theſe are but afflictions falling upon them by evil angells and men: and all of them either voluntarily undertaken or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily accepted and entertained, when they fell upon them, for his love and reſpect, who ſo ſuffered and ſo entered into glory. And the doctour if he were honeſt and truly wife, would never dare to lay fanaticiſme unto Saints, becaus ſome men here in England, who are according to his own definition fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks indeed, pretend ſome of thoſe things, for which antient Saints were much renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He might and ought to remember that theſe good things bear no part at all in the definition of fanaticiſme, but are the very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of evangelical perfection; nor is all evil, which ſuch men do. It is neither wiſdom nor honeſty, nor ſo much as a manly behaviour, to deride good or innocent things even in thoſe men, we may by cuſtome and education diſlike, Papiſts, Quaker, or how ever they be called. By theſe proceedings atheiſme ſpreads its roots in the hearts of thoſe who read ſuch flouts and contumelies,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57867:121"/>perhaps further than the gibeing author of the libell himſelf intended. If the doctour, who by his little parcels of ſtory endeavours to render theſe five great perſons contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, do believe thoſe relations of them to be true; then muſt he needs believe alſo, that the Patriarchs and Prophets, Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and all the Saints of God ſo eſteemed hitherto, were all mad men and fanaticks. If he believe them not, but judg them falſe relations, then is he a mad man himſelf, to conclude them fanaticks by that which never was. So that be the ſtories true or falſe, the doctour will be thought either unwiſe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, which he pleaſes,</p>
               <p>Theſe worthy Sir are the five thoughts, wherewith my mind was then wholly taken up, before I put my Pen to paper: which now, too much tired already with his many impertinencies and falſhoods, I can but only mention. And I wiſh with all my heart, that the doctour had ſo moderated and guided his words, that neither his own Prelates, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grave People of the Land, who cannot but fore-ſee the diſmal event of ſuch wild talk as his is, might not take offence or be ſcandalized thereat.

Only I wiſh with all my heart, that my countrimen would firſt think in their mind, what a comely and bleſſed Land this was, when it was inamelled up and down with ſo many beauteous tabernacles of religious men, in their ſeveral rites and habits chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the praiſes of God night and day, with Hymns, Pſalms and Canticles perpetually, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in common, chaſtly and obediently all their days; After this, if they pleaſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, the hourly imployments of all theſe families throughout the day, while they now worked, now prayed, now ſubdued their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with hard diſciplines, now wrote out books for the uſe of poſterity, now chanted out Gods praiſes, met all together ſeven hours a day in the Quire, and thus ended their lives in the arms of one another, they cannot but applaud that happy ſociety of men thus dedicated to God, and think the Country wherein they live the happier for them. All the many books both greek, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57867:122"/>and hebrew, hiſtorians, oratours, and works of antient Fathers, had never poſſibly been deduced unto our times, had they not been renewed age by age ſtill in ſeveral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms by the labour of theſe religious men, before Printing was invented. Nor had Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſeen any of theſe goodly Churches that remain in it to this day, nor yet enjoied thoſe wiſe and equitable laws, by which this land is ſtill governed, contrived all of them by Catholick Princes, Monks and Biſhops. Nor is Catholick religion againſt the law, as ſome now think, but with the law and the law with it and for it, and by it, however ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>additional ſtatutes have been contrived of late againſt that holy antient faith, ſince the reformation. Thirdly they may conſider if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ey pleas the wondrous convenience of theſe general granaries in a land, religious founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I mean, not only in ſpiritual things, wherin we have good helps and examples all the land over at our own doors; but even in our temporals alſo. For no ſooner was a child born to any man, but he had choice of occaſions to provide for him, without any further coſt or charges both for his ſoul and body: which is a benefit ſo wanted now, that neither high nor low know well now adaies how to diſpoſe of their children. Fourthly, they may call to mind and admire the great
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57867:123"/>love and reſpect the Chriſtian world ever had for thoſe holy orders and their founders, unto whoſe company they flocked continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with exulting hearts. And happy he who could be thought worthy to be admited into their ſociety, even of all ages, ſtates and conditions of men, wherein they profitted ſome of them unto admirable ſanctity and glory: and even the worſt and verieſt tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant among them was yet better, than the wide world would have made him. The one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. Bennet received into it twenty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and ten Empreſſes, forty ſeven Kings and above fifty Queens, twenty Sons of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and forty eight Sons of Kings, about a hundred young Ladies daughters to Kings and Emperours, a hundred other Princes and Princeſſes, Dukes and Dutcheſſes; Marqueſſes Earls and Counteſſes well near two hundred, fifteen Biſhops who left their Miters to live in that happy retired life; and others of the inferiour Gentry innumerable. And thus hath this holy order continued, thus lived and flouriſhed now a thouſand Years in the Chriſtian world, the reſting place of the rich and refuge of the poor. So that all people who lived in thoſe good daies and beheld religious orders, had a contrary judgment of them unto Dr. Stillingfleet who was born but yeſterday, and never ſaw any. Fifthly, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57867:123"/>eminence of learning in all theſe orders, and the books of all ſorts and kinds, that have iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from them, who is able to recount them? No ſort of knowledg, no kind of literature has eſcaped them. The one order of St. Bennet has brought forth fifteen thouſand ſeven hundred. Monks, eminent writers and compilers of books. The Academies were all antiently in their Monaſteries. At one Abbey in France called Fleury were brought up at once four thouſand Students. Their Rabanus ſet up the School of Germany. Their Alcuinus founded the Univerſity of Paris. Their Bede advanced our Oxford Univerſity, firſt renewed by Theodore and Adrian benedictin Monks alſo. Their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Exiguus perfected the Eccleſiaſtical computation. Their Guido made the ſcale of Muſick. Their Silverſter invented the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Theirs were Anſelmus, Ildephonſus, Bernardus and Rupertus, the four Marian Doctours: and what not? Sixthly, if we pleaſe to conſider the multitudes of glorious men in theſe five orders, who had received a double portion of their Fathers ſpirit, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeus is ſaid to have got of Elias above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sons of the Prophets; who wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l then be able to recount the eminent Saints, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, Martyrs, Apoſties and Converters of Countries, that have iſſued out of theſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57867:124"/>divine Sanctuaries. The one order of St. Bennet has brought forth forty thouſand bleſſed Confeſſours, above three thouſand Martyrs; Miſſioners and Apoſtles, ſo many and powerful, that they have converted no leſs than thirty Provinces unto Chriſtian faith. St. Bennet himſelf converted Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, which had remained Pagan even to his daies; St. Leander part of Spain; St. Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and his companions much of Germany and Haſſia; St. Amand, Willebrord, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, Switbert, with their fellow Monks, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium, Holland, Friſeland and South Saxony: St. Willehade, Dacia, Gothland and Groon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: St. Kilian and Lambert, the Taxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians and other Germans: St Lugdurus, Adalbertus and other Monks out of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of Corbey, Pannonia, Sarmatia, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Muſcovy. St. Steven Suec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a, St. Bruno Lituania, St. Albo Gaſcony, another St. Boniface Sclavonia, St. Otho Pomerania, St. Winkelin Wandalia, and St. Auſtin with his good Monks ſent hither by St. Gregory made all our England Chriſtian, wherein we now l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve. For though our learned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Antiquary Mr. Broughton doth think that St. Auſtin and his holy Monks brought hither with them the rule of St. Gregory, diſtinct from that of St. Bennet, yet that is of ſmall concernment to my purpoſe now in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57867:124"/>hand; eſpecially ſince that rule and all the former rules in our Britany, did unite at laſt in St. Bennets rule, as leſſer lights in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sun. And ſhould I mention the holy Confeſſors, learned Writers, valiant Martyrs, and vigorous Apoſtles, all thoſe glorious men in the orders of St. Francis, St. Dominick, St. Bruno, and other ſuch like founders, bright ſtars now out of our ſight, yet ſhining in a higher heaven the day would fall me. My voyage is now bent another way. And therefore great Servants of God, ſpirits inkindled from heaven, brave vertuous hearts raiſed up even in your mortal pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage above mortality it ſelf, let it ſuffice I love you. Time will bring forth a better Pen to recount your names in a character more worthy of you than mine is. I muſt go hence.</p>
               <p>By this little Sir we may diſcern, if the God of this world hath not utterly blinded our eyes, that theſe holy orders were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wiſdom of God and power of God, and not in Stillingfleetiſme. For counſels of men come to nought; but what is of God is laſting: as wiſe Gamaliel diſcourſed in a councel of the Jewes The order of St. Dominick, St. Bruno, Romwall and St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis have been ſix hundred years in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world; St. Bennet almoſt twice as long;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57867:125"/>and yet live. What is of God is powerful of it ſelf, without any worldly helps of force or ſubtilty. What is of God is ſervent and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous. What is of God, however it may ſeem diſtaſtful at the firſt, becomes dayly more delectable, attractive, and pleaſing. What is of God is zealous of God, loves and bends towards God, thinks nothing hard, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tedious, nothing heavy, that is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for Gods cauſe. All time is well ſpent in his ſervice, all difficulties eaſy, all labour pleaſant, all mortification comfortable, all our members too few for his imployment, all the blood in our vains too little to ſhed for his love. And all this fervour and conſtancy, love of God and amiableneſs to men, zeal and vigour, purity and perſeverance were looked upon and approved and imitated to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer by ſuch as lived here in England in the days of holy Catholick religion with all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly comfort: however now out of ſight it be all out of mind too; ſo much out of mind, that Dr. Stillingfleet calling it fanaticiſme expects an applauſe for his labour. The grand Turk a great enemy of Chriſtians, when he looked upon poor humble St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis (who having come a long journey unto his converſion, made his way unto him by the very majeſty of his countenance and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of GOD that went along with him,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57867:125"/>through all his Guard and Nobility about him) the grand Seigneur had ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for the man, that diſmiſſing all that were about him, he took him into his cloſet and there converſt with him many hours in private ſeveral times. And thence at laſt he diſmiſt him with ſo much peace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as if he had been not a man but an Angel of God rather, appearing upon earth. And this thing was never done to any in that Court, either before that time or ſince. But the doctour never ſaw either St. Francis, or St. Dominick, St. Bruno, or St. Bennet, or any of their orders: and therfore ſpeaks of things utterly unknown to him according to the malice of his own heart, be the truth what it will. It was once a Chriſtian leſſon in England, that we ſhould ſpeak of the dead nothing but good; and of the living no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth. But he does neither.</p>
               <p>§ 14. From hence the author proceeds to a new argument fit as he thinks to prove the Church of Romes fanaticiſme, which indeed ſo exalts her honour, that it proves her the only powerful Judg that does ſuppreſs it. <hi>He tells us then a long and punctual ſtory of ſome diſturbances and hereſies that roſe about three hundred Years ago in the Chriſtian world, who were the chief authors, when and where
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57867:126"/>they firſt appeared, how far they ſpread, what tumults they cauſed, what Catholick Doctours oppoſed them, and what Pope at laſt cenſured and ſilenced them. And this was the hereſy of the Fratricelli, Begwini, and ſuch like others.</hi> And he is ſo exact in his narration, that he ſpends almoſt forty pages in it, thereby to daz'e the Reader, and lead him on ſo far that he may not reflect upon the impertinence of it. For hereſies will riſe, and the firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe of them muſt needs be amongſt ſome who lived thitherto in the Catholick Church. And if they will not hear and be quiet as the reſt are, they will be cenſured in the end; And this was all the buſineſs here. <hi>But the Doctour twits at the Pope, for that he delayed his cenſure ſo long, ſtill favouring the Fryars, amongſt whom there were ſome great ſticklers in that madneſs.</hi> Surely Sir it is a part not of prudence only but juſtice too in any judg, to hear all parties ſpeak, and to defer an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſentence, till he ſee where it is moſt due. And ſometimes the commotion is ſo diſorderly, wild or amb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they were not fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; then all the Doctours narration is but a tale of Tom Thumb. I can tell the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of another fanaticiſme far greater and of more diſmal conſequence than this, which roſe up in the Catholick Church, but one hundred Years ago, begun, promoted and ſpread over half Europe, by Martin Luther an Auguſtin Fryar, John Calvin a Prieſt, and as I think a Cannon too, Swing ins who I am ſure was both, Carolſtade an arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con in Wittenburg, Bucer a Dominican Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, Liſmanin a franciſcan, Richerius a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melite.

                  </gap>d they now hold forth, and what did they pretend and teach? a perfect fanaticiſme, here deſcribed by the Doctour; and both the waies of it:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57867:127"/>both a new enthuſiaſtick way of Religion; and a reſiſting of authority under pretence of it. They would have now no more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Prelates; which is the very eſſence of fanaticiſme; no obligation to the religious duties, wherein they had hicherto been trained, no reſpect to Church laws, or rules of diſcipline, faſts, or other obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The beſt works were ſins. Reſtitution ſuperfluous. Monaſteries and religious retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuperſtitious. Gods law impoſſible to be kept. No oblation, no altar, no prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood any more: And ſuch negatives innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. This was their new religion; the maddeſt that ever was broched upon earth, and far ſhort even of Pagan honeſty. And how did they go on? Even with point of pen and force of arms; defying and defaming all Superiority upon earth. They razed and threw to the ground hundreds of fair Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Churches, filled all Germany, where the fanaticiſme began, with ruins, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted England, Ireland, Denmark, Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all the Iſlands here abouts; and pillaged the whole Kingdoms. This fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick hereſy was oppoſed by all the learned Catholicks in Chriſtendom, and cenſured, not by the Pope only, but by a general councel of Biſhops gathered together round about, to apply their helping hands; and ſtop the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57867:127"/>ruin. And yet has this one dangerous infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction been yet too ſtrong for all indeavour. Other leſſer fanaticiſmes have yielded to the inceſſant care and vigilance of Catholick Prelates. But this of Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§ 15. After this, <hi>the Doctour gives us the ſtory of St. Ignace Founder of the Society.</hi> So contumeliouſly related; that his converſion to a ſtricter life, by reading the lives of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Saints; his backwardneſs to human li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, his patient ſufferings, and travels to and fro, as his pious purpoſes led him, his faſting and meditations, the examinations made of his rigorous courſe of life, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious oppoſitions, his gathering Diſciples and indeavour to have his rule confirmed by the Supreme Biſhop, are all made to ſound conformably either to Don Quixots Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, or the eſteemed madneſſes of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who are, ſaith he, at leaſt Grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the founder of the Jeſuits. Truly theſe Quakers either are, or muſt it ſeems be thought, an odd kind of people. They are Benedictins, Franciſcans, Dominicans, Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its; and all within the compaſs of one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57867:128"/>And yet they profeſs none of all this, nor know nothing of it. But here Sir, you may perceive at leaſt, how eaſy it is to make a pious and ſerious matter to ſound ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or wild by the meer manner of relating it; which is a great and neceſſary caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poiſon of ſlanderous tongues.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57867:128"/>genuin, nor likely to be fixt and conſtant, becaus he was not a Prophet of prophets nor had his ſpirit from them. So may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe think of this worthy ſociety of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, that ſuch a ſtable gravity and fixed wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as is in them all, muſt needs be derived unto them from the ſpirit and ſtatutes of their founder. That is I think a true moral phyſiognomy which is given us by the Lyrick poet, eſpecially in a continual ſucceſſion of men. <hi>Fortes creantur fortibus &amp; bonis. Eſt in juvencis, eſt in equis patrum Virtus, nec im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles ferocem Progenerant aquilam columbae.</hi> But let St. Ignace be never ſo ſimple, yet did he ever ſubmit unto his Superiours and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, walking all his daies in Catholick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and had his rule of life confirmed by his Prelate; and therfore could be no fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, according to the Doctours definition of it. He neither invented any new way of religion, nor yet reſiſted authority under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it. But I think the doctour gave us that definition of fanaticiſme, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this his Chapter, only to keep his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe far enough off, and never to touch it.</p>
               <p>§ 16. <hi>The Doctour proceeds now to declare how the very Catholick way of devotion doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote enthuſiaſme.</hi> And what think you Sir, doth he ſpeak of here? not one word of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57867:129"/>daily pſalms, hymns, canticles, anthems, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred leſſons, doxologies, our Lords prayer or any other devotion preſcribed by the Church, and almoſt hourly in the hands and eyes of Catholick people: not a word of our examination of our ſelves upon our knees, penitential petitions, or other our obſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thankſgivings deprecations or interpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for our ſelves and all other good Chriſtian people, for Kings and prelates and all conſtituted in authority over us, that we may live a peaceable and quiet life with all piety and decent behaviour. No mention of all this, which he knows as I perceive by his talking of our Manuels and Breviaries, to be our Catholick devotion; no not one word. What is it then he calls the Catholick way of devotion? Only one ſpiritual book ſet forth by Mr. Creſſy about twenty Years ago out of Father Baxers works, wherin the Doctour finds ſome uncouth hard words which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand: this is that which he calls Catholick devotion: and this is all the way he ſhows that Catholick devotion promotes enthuſiaſme. Have not I reaſon Sir to be weary in following after ſuch a butterfly?</p>
               <p>§ 17. He tells us at laſt, <hi>That Papiſts are guilty of reſiſting authority under pretence of religion, which he proves firſt by the principles
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57867:129"/>of the Jeſuitical party which are deſtructive to government, and Secondly by this that the ſaid party are moſt countenanced in the Court of Rome.</hi> But he never tells us what are theſe principles of the Jeſuitical party, nor what this Jeſuitical party is. He only names <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana and one or two others who ſhould ſay that a Prince excommunicated loſes his Soveraignty;</hi> For which boldneſs they ſuffered worthily both by their own body and others. Now how this diſcourſe of our Doctour agrees with his purpoſe all this while pretended here I cannot ſee. For it has not ſo much as the colour which appeared in ſome ſort hitherto. His book is intitled <hi>A Diſcourſe of the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous fanaticiſme of the Church of Rome:</hi> but now he tells us of a Jeſuitical party and the Court of Rome. The Society of Jeſuits, a religious grave prudent family in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church of God, this I have heard of: and the Church of Rome, or Catholick Church I know. But what is this Jeſuitical party, and what this Court of Rome I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not at all. The Doctour pretended to ſpeak of the Church and her religion, though indeed he hath never come neer it yet. But now he ſpeaks that which hath not ſo much as the ſound of it. A Jeſuitical party and a Court, what are theſe to our purpoſe now in hand? There be parties and as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57867:130"/>ſigns, as there be men in this world, although they ſhould be all of one religion; and not all of them, nay not perhaps one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand directed according to Goſpel or right reaſon at all times, but for avarice rather, ſolicitude of this world, or ſenſuality. Who can mend this? Or whoſe part is it to juſtify ſuch things? No man that defends a religion, can conceive how they may concern him; and he that oppoſes a religion, if he were wiſe or honeſt, would never object them. And as for the Court of Rome, I know no more of it then I do of the Court of France, Spain or Conſtantinople. I have long ſince been told, that the deſigns of Courts and Courtiers, are politick, high, ambitious, and cloſe. And I have heard again that they are of one and the ſame opinion all over the face of the earth, a high elevated ſecret myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way, unknown to us peaſants who are born in ſin, although it go under the name ſtill of that rurall religion which is counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in their reſpective Kingdoms. How true theſe things be, and what this way of theirs is I know not, nor do I love to ſpeak of them at all. One part of our duty I think and reſpect towards our Superiours is ſilence, and not to ſpeak at all of them. For we may conclude that God ſubjected all other Creatures un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o man, becaus he created them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57867:130"/>dumb. And certainly enough may we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the opinions of Courts and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are very high, ſince one can hardly meet any ordinary man, who would not have the whole earth under his command and power, if he could get it: It is not long ſince we had here threeſcore thouſand of our own Proteſtant Countrymen armed in the field who held all of them an opinion that the Kings Crown was at their diſpoſal. So they wrote, ſo they talked, and ſo they acted. And it is hard to ſay in what head are the moſt preſumptuous, ambitious, and lofty opinions. And our Doctour himſelf who ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly treats King Pepin, Charlemaign, and other renowned Kings of the earth, nay all the Catholicks in the world at once, cannot be one of the humbleſt and modeſteſt of men. Court of Rome, and Jeſuitical party, ſounds in my ears like a thorough Baſs, and treble Violyn playing together; the one ſtrikeing three long humming Notes about the double Gamut; the other deſcanting theron in ſhort and quicker graces. The Court of Rome I ſomething perceive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks what it ſhould be, but not what it is: But the Jeſuitical party with all its graces, I neither know what it is, nor what it ſhould be. That worthy Society of Jeſuits may be conſidered either according to their religion,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57867:131"/>or Schools, or perſonal deſigns. According to their religion they are as other Catholicks be, in the ſame worſhip, ſame Sacraments, ſame Altar, ſame Prieſthood, ſame faith, ſame hope to come. As to their Schools, although they have I believe five hundred Readers of the Chair, and perhaps as many publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſions in every three years ſpace: yet did I never hear of any ſuch thing either taught or defended in their Schools, which is here put upon the Jeſuitical party: And yet it is nothing to our purpoſe if it were. But as to the perſonal deſigns of them or any others we can no more dive into them, then into the ſeveral wandering thoughts and purpoſes of men, muſeing daily in London-ſtreets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their affairs. And one man or other thus muſeing amiſs amongſt the Jeſuits, can no more be called the Jeſuitical party, then ſuch a one here in England be termed the Engliſh party. Mariana I am ſure has been ſoundly checkt amongſt them and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks for his fault here ſpoken of. And if the Court or Courtiers of Rome have any fancy, that they are higher than Kings, and by their excommunication can render them Kings no more, as this Doctour here ſpeaks, this may argue indeed that they are a high minded people. But Courtiers do not walk ſo exactly according to our Chriſtian
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57867:131"/>religion, that this can prove that vanity of theirs, to be any part of it. Catholick Kings who have been here in England well nigh twenty ſince the Conqueſt, more among the Saxons, and others not a few amongſt our antient Brittains; and the preſent Catholick Kings of France, Spain, the Emperour, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princes and others have and do all know well enough, that ſuch a fancy is no part of our Catholick religion. Nor did our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth who firſt left it off, expreſs any ſuch cauſe or reaſon for it: The times would be very good and happy if all the words and actions of every particular man were anſwerable to his holy faith. But this is not to be expected in this evil world. And to call that religion which is done or ſpoken contrary unto it, is a very great injury and injuſtice. Our holy religion teaches us to obſerve and obey our Kings and Superiours, as Gods Vicegerents upon earth, though they be Infidels and Pagans, and rather to lay down our lives for them, then ſuffer them to be hurt. And this is nothing but the very law of Nature antecedent to any religion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and holds good although there were neither heaven nor hell, nor any reward or puniſhment to come. And what power can any man upon earth have to take that away which he never gave, nor ever had. He that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57867:132"/>creates can only annihilate. So long as kings are Catholicks, the Pope prays for them. And if they ceaſe to be ſo, he is nothing to them any more. And yet are they the ſame they were, in all their royalty and power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulably. If the King of France ſhould receive the Garter from our King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he is thought to be ſo long his friend, as he is pleaſed to wear it. But if he throw it off, he is King of France ſtill, as much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was. I know not what the Court or Courtiers of Rome may think or ſay in this buſineſs: For what the Doctour here tells us about the Iriſh remonſtrance, is a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal buſineſs, and not ſo circumſtanced that one can draw any general concluſion or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from it. But if they be only ſo much as ſaid either to have conceived or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced any ſuch opinion looked upon by all Catholicks and good Chriſtians upon earth, as ungrounded, fals and impious, it behoves them I ſhould think, both for the publick good, honour of Catholick religion and their own credit to ſee it cenſured with all ſpeed, that the progreſs of Chriſtianity be not ſtopped by it. For no Pagan King will venture at a promiſe of everlaſting felicity with the hazard of his Crown at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of one man whom he never ſaw nor knows. Sure I am if any ſuch opinion had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57867:132"/>been heard of when Chriſtianity was firſt planted in Kingdoms it had never found footing in this world. And if it be now countenanced, the progreſs of Chriſtianity is at an end.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, but that a Cotholick writer may in his controverſy about religion, if ſo he pleas, defend an opinion alſo of any one or other who has profeſſed the Catholick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which he maintains. But this is more then any one needs to do. For religion is quite another thing, derived from another, authour and original, eſtabliſhed in another manner, no leſs differing from an opinion, then a fixed ſtar in the firmament from the miſt or fog ariſeing from the earth.

                  </gap>h is one known thing, but opinions are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable and endleſs. If the various opinions, entertained in mens minds but one only day in any City of England were all faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded at night, they would exhibite to a Reader a moſt prodigious ſpectacle. Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are infinitly various, infinitly changable, infinitely contradictory and abſurd in the world. Nor may we doubt but that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them are contrary both to religion and law. Angry rageing men and wanton women, unfaithful ſervants, and di obedient children, theevs and murderers, cheats and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, can we think when they act according to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57867:133"/>their own diſordered paſſions, that they hold not then an opinion, that in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is expedient for them ſo to do? Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners hold wicked opinions, be the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion what it will. Gainſay and blame them in their heat; and it will ſoon appear, that they are ſtiff and reſolved in that their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the very fury of their wrath. And what will not ſycophants and flatterers ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay or write, to pleas the mind of thoſe on whom they depend, even againſt their own. Rules of law and religion are fixt and ſtable and ever the ſame. But opinions are moveable as water: and never right but when conformable to a right rule of ſome good law: and how far they are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo far are they right and no more. And therfore it is a madneſs in any one who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to write againſt the ſtandard of a religion, to object inſtead of that, opinions of men. For firſt one man may have an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to day and write it alſo in a book; and yet few years after, nay perhaps very few days, change his mind. Secondly the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one man may be gain-ſaid by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand as wiſe as he, who live under the ſame law and religion. Thirdly an opinion in a book is indeed nothing at all in the world, but a meer p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57867:133"/>which actuate it and make the action really to be: and ſome opinions are worſe then nothing. For which reaſon all the multitude of opinions which ſill up the books of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Caſuiſts may be exerciſes of wit indeed; but no guids can they be unto action. The direction of a liveing Oracle and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour who can penetrate all preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and preſcribe by his wiſdom on which ſide is then moſt of good and leaſt of evil; which is the only rule that directs a wiſe counſellour what to determin, this only is our guide in doubts. Wherfore the great Princes of the earth recurre not to books in their difficulties, but uſe the wiſdom of their counſel, wiſe and grave men who muſt hear all things that can be ſaid on both ſides, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and ponder them deeply before a judgment can reſult. And it often happens amongſt them, that they will determin in one year that action to be rejected, which was in another time expedient and good, only upon change of circumſtances. It is in my mind a vain labour to write long diſcourſes about probable opinions as ſome do. For if we ſpeak of an opinion in a ſtrict ſence, an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tending to action, and yet ſeparated or abſtracted from all circumſtances of perſon, time, place, means, motives, events, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions with ill or welfare, which no writer
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57867:134"/>of a book can ſee; ſuch an opinion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in the world but a meer fantoſme, more apt to miſlead then ſecure any action of life. And he that goes to a book to learn there, how he is to act in any buſineſs he is about, goes like one blind man to another blind guide to lead him. For this reaſon all antient good Chriſtians ever had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly I cannot but grieve to ſee men talk ſo much as they do now adaies, about opinions. For we are to hold nothing but Goſpell and our holy Chriſtian tradition, and no opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at all in religious affaires. And if opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do riſe therin, as needs they muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by variation of circumſtances, that is ſtill to be rejected, which moſt ſwarves from the intent of holy Goſpel, or, (which is all one) hath leaſt in it of good and moſt of ill. Let not only three men but three millions of men hold any thing to the breach of this rule, it is not to be heeded. They who write books of moral actions and conſcience, can know nothing either of the perſon actually concerned, or of the various circumſtances which muſt bring this action into a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57867:134"/>(let them in their abſtracted aery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems ſay what they pleaſe) nor innumerable events therof; although there be ſome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that no circumſtance can juſtify. Nor do Catholick Kings and Princes ever heed at all, what people talk in their Schools and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies, unleſs it proceed to action. If any do act well, he has peace: and if any do ill, death is at his door, however opinions go. But of this enough. Doctor Still. threatens us here with a more accurate examination of theſe things from the authour who wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Apology for Catholicks.</hi> I know not who that Authour is.

               <p>§ 18. Sir one miſtake of mine commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my firſt packet, wherin I told you that this piece of Fanaticiſme was Doctour Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet's own proper invention, <hi>I</hi> muſt here revoke. For it is not ſo. I wondred indeed, that in his arguments againſt the Church of Rome, ſet down in the begining of his book, wherin is mention made of that Churches I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, hinderances of a good life, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, there was not there any one word of Fanaticiſme which here fills up a whole cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter in his book, compiled as himſelf ſpeaks in defence of thoſe arguments. But <hi>I</hi> was inlighten'd in this my doubt by a meer chance. For meeting with a Proteſtant Stationer, <hi>I</hi> asked him if he ever heard of an Authour called <hi>Foolis</hi> or <hi>Foulis,</hi> who is quoted once or twice by Doctour Stillingfleet. <hi>O</hi> quoth he preſently, <hi>Foolis is an aſſe; he printed laſt year an eccleſiastical hiſtory, wherein he ſays that Papiſh Saints were fanaticks. I had the book, but threw it out of my ſhop: It is ſold now up and down the ſtreets for waſt paper. I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered then with my ſelf, that the Doctour's arguments were made as himſelf ſpeaks, two
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57867:136"/>Years ago: this his book in defence of them is but now printed, and Foolis his book a Year ago came forth. My riddle is now out. The Doctour never dreamed of fanaticiſme, till he learned it of Foolis. And yet does he not quote this Foulis in all his Chapter of Fanaticiſme, though he does in another; ambitious it ſeems to have the honour of the invention aſcribed to himſelf alone. Nor is it hard, ſince Foolis his book is become waſt paper, to find out, not the Maſter only from whom our Doctour learned his leſſon of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſme, but the very chair alſo wheron he ſat, when firſt he learned it; fith bookiſh men are very apt to peruſe the waſt paper they are then to uſe. But it was a lucky chance for Doctour Stillingfleet. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied therefore his waſt paper; and ſaying in his heart, Here is a gallant matter for a whole new Chapter in my book, he roſe and tied up his breeches.</p>

            <p>UNto this fifth Chapter <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpeak Sir very little: becaus it is wholly parer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, and beſides his or what ought to be his purpoſe. A Reader who looks upon his book conceives him to ſpeak of diviſions which are contrary to their unity of faith. And yet the Doctour by a multitude of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which make up this chapter, exemplifies only and declares diviſions that have been in ſeveral times and places, contrary to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of affections; in matter of honor, wealth, and power; ſome in Italy, ſome in France, ſome in England, ſome in America, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their School conceptions, ſome about power and juriſdiction, liberty and freedom, and the like. So that all that has happened in the Catholick world the ſpace of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, contrary to that peace, humility,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57867:137"/>love, tendernes, juſtice, mercy, patience, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which religion requires, ſo much of it as he found related in Catholick authors to his hand, is the miſcellan hodg podg of this his fifth chapter, called Diviſions, not ever intended by any of thoſe Catholicks authors unto Dr. Still. purpoſe, unto which the ſaid ſtories are wholly improper.</p>

For even in thoſe worſt

And all that <hi>I</hi> think can be judiciouſly gathered from theſe many diſmal ſtories and miſerable ſcandals, is only this, that in all ſuch diſtreſſes and ever we are ſtill to truſt in God, and in the vertue of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who has promiſed to be with us even to the worlds conſummation. And if he be with us, we ſhall be well, be what will againſt us, whether it riſe within the Church or fall upon it from without. The Catholick Church muſt taſt all the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and temptations which may render her conformable to her Lord and head, both from friends and foes. And it is enough
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57867:140"/>that he watches over us who never ſleeps, and ſuffers no more to befall us then will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his own glory in the end.</p>
            <p>But I wonder much, how the Doctour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the many differences and broils here recorded, could omit to relate the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt the Kings of France and Spain now daily ſounding in our ears, unto the ſad and woful ruin of ſo many thouſand people. But he is ſubtle, and thinks perhaps, if he ſhould ſpeak of ſuch publick things now in preſent action, that every one would be able to tell him preſently, that the ſaid diſcourſe is nothing to the purpoſe, for that the ſaid Kings and their whole Kingdoms are all in a perfect unity of their Catholick faith for all that. And therefore he judges it a wiſer part, to hunt farther from home, as foxes do; where ordinary Readers cannot ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his impertinency. If he do ſpeak any thing near our own times, it muſt be the wranglings of ſome obſcure men unknown to us; if he relate the differences of greater men, they muſt be ſuch as are far removed off, four, five, nine hundred years ago; and then he hopes that his Reader may not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcover his fraud. For the ſame reaſon he omits alſo to ſpeak of the great wars and differences between the hous of York and Lancaſter here in England, which brought
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57867:141"/>with them as diſmal effects, as any here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by him; as alſo the Wars of England with France unto the utter depopulation in a manner of that whole Kingdom. And yet did their unity of faith ſtand all the while inyiolable. And this truth, becaus it is known to every Reader, therefore will not the ſubtle Doctor make any mention of theſe things. But I cannot ſo well tell, why he ſhould omit the ſtory of the Arrian hereſy, which diſturbed not one Kingdom only, but all the whole Chriſtian world, Europe, Aſia and Africa, ſo far as the very Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament looked upon it. And thoſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were indeed about a point of faith (which nothing is here in all the differences related by the Doctor) Secondly, they brought with them unſpeakable moleſtations and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages all the world over, far further then theſe his related differences ever reached: Thirdly, they laſted four hundred Years, whereas moſt of theſe his differences were little and light, and perſonal or national, and none of them ſo laſting as the troubles of Arrianiſm. So peeviſh, obſtinate and ſelf-will'd are men, even againſt all rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian piety and moderation, when concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and paſſion are once ingaged. And yet was that Arrian diſpute ſo quaint and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, that the world hardly diſcerns, where
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57867:141"/>the difference lay, which ſo much incenſed all the Catholick Prelates in the world, and ſet in ſuch a deadly fewd ſo many great and holy men on both ſides, who had guided their Flocks before in all tranquillity and peace. But what reaſon ſoever the Doctour had for his omiſſion of this Arrian hereſy, which is more pertinent than any of all his ſtories put together; yet might he not me-thinks have utterly forgot the famous and renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtory of Robin Hood, who was a noble perſon and well beloved of his Countrey: and yet out-lawed by his King who profeſſed the ſame Catholick religion with him, was forced to confine himſelf to woods and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, in much hunger and diſtreſs, and daily dangers of his life. If he had bethought himſelf well, he might have printed here the whole Hiſtory of England and France, Spain and Italy, Germany, Poland and Greece. And it would have made him a fine long chapter. Eſpecially if he had inſerted all the wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and law-ſuits, that have happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians in all the ſaid Kingdoms from their firſt converſion, for above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, unto this laſt age, when Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy firſt ſhowed its head. But in all that time, there is not an Authour upon earth, who mentions any wars, any wranglings, any diviſion of Proteſtants. For neither Ceſar
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57867:142"/>nor Pompey, however miſchievous made any troubles, before they were born: nor did any writer take notice of thoſe turbulent war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours from the time of Picus firſt King of the Latines unto their daies; which was little leſs than the ſame ſpace of time that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were in a deep ſilence and peace, all over the whole Chriſtian world, fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. I have no more now to ſay but dear Sir farewell, and continue ſtill to love and pray for</p>
